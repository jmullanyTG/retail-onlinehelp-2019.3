        <p>Supersessions are used to create accurate demand forecasts for items with little or no history. Supersessions are paramount when you launch a new product and need to plan the right quantity of that product in your stores or warehouses. 
		You link the new product to a similar existing product or products, and Demand Management creates demand forecasts for the new item based on the  sales history of the existing item. You can also use supersessions to set up replacement strategies that replenish the existing item's stock with the new item. </p>
