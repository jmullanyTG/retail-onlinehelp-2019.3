        <h1>Status Information</h1>
        <p>Status information will give users an “at a glance” overview of the pertinent information related to the inventory on a daily basis. Many of the standard exception filters will return information which will require the user’s attention, such as potential stock outs, shortfalls, excess stock, or orders which fall outside of the normal cycle.</p>
        <h2>Allocation vs Replenishment status</h2>
        <p>The Status Information tab displays allocation- or replenishment-related information depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the </p>
        <p>Demand&#160;Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite ("Replenishment", for short).</p>
        <p>If you have both the Allocations module and the Replenishment suite enabled in your instance of Demand Management, the Allocation Strategy Selection field in the <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Strategy grid field reference.htm">Allocation Strategy</a> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. You can add the <b>Execution Process</b> column to your Inventory Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are "Allocations engine" or "Replenishment engine".</p>
