        <h1>Task Example: Identifying Surplus Orders</h1>
        <p>This task example examines  individual items to investigate what is causing excess orders to be generated.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the heading “Surplus Order Value” to sort that column and find the biggest 10 values under the ReplenFlag = checked section.</li>
            <li>Double click on the row of an item with a really large surplus and the screen will split in half showing the “Item Detail” pane on the bottom.<p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Task Example Identifying Surplus Orders.png" /></p></li>
            <li>Click on the “Forecast Viewer” tab first and see if you notice anything in the current forecast which could cause this item to be over ordered. Immediately I can see that this forecast looks considerably high for what I would be expecting so I should pull up the product for this SKU and maybe do some forecast adjustments. <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Task Example Identifying Surplus Orders_1.png" /></p></li>
            <li>Click on another one of the items and pull up the “Stock Holding Projections” tab and try to see where the red line (Projected SOH) will jump up before it is needed, below shows a good example of where the red line jumps up almost a month before it is actually needed. <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Task Example Identifying Surplus Orders_2.png" /></p></li>
            <li>Now click on the “Inbound and Outbound Orders” tab and see if there are any orders outstanding that could potentially be cancelled or moved out to a later date and you will see that the current order due in on the 20th June could actually be cancelled and ordered in at a later time. <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Task Example Identifying Surplus Orders_3.png" /></p></li>
            <li>Lastly click on the “Status Information” tab and see that all the data we have been manually investigating is summarized in this tab. It is up to the user to construct the best possible report to quickly isolate and action problem inventory. <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Task Example Identifying Surplus Orders_4.png" /></p></li>
