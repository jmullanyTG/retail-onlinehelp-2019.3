        <h1>Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts</h1>
        <p>In instances where users have constructed a report, they may wish to save the fields and layout for future use. This means when they are at the Choose Fields screen, they are able to quickly select a previously saved layout and easily get columns into the grid. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First ensure that there are no filters active on your grid, check that there is no writing in the headers and also no items selected in the little funnels. <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> If you save a layout with filters applied you will get the behavior below each time you open your layout.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts.png" /></p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Right click anywhere on the data and select <b>Save Layout</b>.</p>

            </li>
            <li>Give the Layout a meaningful name and then check or uncheck the default box depending on if you want this layout to be the default layout. <![CDATA[  ]]><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts dialog completing fields.png" /></p><p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Most of the time you will choose private unless you are creating a layout that other members on your team will use. </p></li>
