        <h1>Inventory Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>Inventory Manager is a powerful, yet flexible tool for monitoring and managing the inventory planning process at the inventory (item/location) level. It is a central hub of information within Demand Management, helping you to quickly drive inventory-related decisions. Within the Inventory Manager, you can build reports, manage inventory-level policies, and more.</p>
        <p>The data displayed in reports such as the Stock Holding Projection are the results of the ordering engine run (typically a nightly task).</p>
        <h2>Filter-driven item management</h2>
        <p>Users can streamline workflow processes through managing by exception. By using dynamic exception filters within Inventory Manager, you can quickly identify items which require your attention and go to work on them immediately. Filters can be tied to a dashboard making it easier to prioritize work. </p>
        <h2>Centralized information</h2>
        <p>Inventory Manager is a one-stop shop for inventory-related information about your items, displaying information from your ERP&#160;system as well as other Demand Management modules. Available information includes (but is not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory information such as inventory ID, stock on hand, and cost price.</li>
            <li>Demand forecasts for the item (from the Forecast module).</li>
            <li>Inventory-specific inbound and outbound orders for the item.</li>
            <li>Inter-site projected demand for the item</li>
            <li>Supply information such as lead time, order multiple, min/max quantities, and alternate suppliers.</li>
            <li>Inventory policy parameters for the item (from the Policy module)</li>
            <li>Status information </li>
            <li>Stock holding projections</li>
            <li>Multi-site inventory at the item master level</li>
            <li>Financial planning information (from the Merchandise Financial Planning module)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Customizable views</h2>
        <p>A wealth of information is available within Inventory Manager, but you probably won't want to see it all at once. With flexible field selectors and powerful pivoting capabilities, .you can quickly create and save custom views that enable you to focus on just the information related to your tasks.</p>
        <h2>Life cycle management </h2>
        <p>You can perform many tasks within Inventory Manager, including managing the <a href="Defining Item Life Cycle Dates.htm">phase-in and phase-out dates</a> of your items. Demand Management's ordering engine uses these dates to optimize its recommended purchase orders at each end of an item's life cycle, calibrating order quantities accordingly. </p>
