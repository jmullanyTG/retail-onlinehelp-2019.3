        <h1>Forecast Viewer</h1>
        <p>The <b>Forecast Viewer</b> tab will display identical information to that which may be found in the <b>Forecasts</b> module. Additional information may be found within the Forecasts module help documentation. Users can configure the colors of the various available series within the graph selecting a color palette which is most appealing and accessible for them.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">The ability to configure a series’ color requires user right <b>Allow Series Configuration</b>.</p>

        <h2>Allocation vs Replenishment forecasts</h2>
        <p>The <b>Forecast Viewer</b> tab displays allocation- or replenishment-related forecast data depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the </p>
        <p>Demand&#160;Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite ("Replenishment", for short). </p>
        <p>If you have both the Allocations module and the Replenishment suite enabled in your instance of Demand Management, the <b>Allocation Strategy Selection</b> field in the <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Strategy grid field reference.htm">Allocation Strategy</a> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. You can add the <b>Execution Process</b> column to your Inventory Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are "Allocations engine" or "Replenishment engine".</p>
        <h2>Inventory view and level forecast view status bar</h2>
        <p>A status bar is supported in both inventory and level forecast views which lets you display additional metadata based on the row selection or cells within a row. You can highlight certain cells within a row or a whole row and view the sum, average, count, minimum, and maximum values in the status bar at the bottom of the grid.</p>
        <p>To display the status bar, right-click in the grid and select the <b>Status Bar</b> menu option.</p>
