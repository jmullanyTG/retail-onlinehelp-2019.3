        <h1>Order Manager Overview</h1>
        <p> Order Manager provides a central location to review, modify, and authorize orders. You can also view orders by status, create new oders based on allocations or Ad Hoc, and view the summary of the order details in a pivot grid.</p>
        <p>Regular supplier orders, direct supplier drop-ship orders, transfers, allocations, commitments, and distributions can all be controlled in a document-centric format while following workflow rules established to conform to the business requirements.</p>
        <p>Order Manager documents are available dependent on user access and rights. Because these document types are related to different processes, their fields and associated views are likely to differ. </p>
        <p>The contents in the header of an Order Manager document depends on the order document type. The header may contain information, such as ownership, security rights, workflow details, and narrative status.</p>
        <p>After created, Order Manager documents can be viewed and updated (based on the header status) through the Navigation pane. Depending on the user-assigned rights, you can view or edit documents in varying states of approval, or advance the document through the pre-defined workflow steps.</p>
