        <h1>Order Document Details – Prepack </h1>
        <p>The Prepack tab allows users to further enrich order line details by allocating the units by size determined in Break By Size into pre-pack configurations defined in the Variant Manager module. In the Prepack tab, users can define a number of constraints to help guide the optimization process, including the % split between prepacks and singles.</p>

        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;margin-left: 36pt;color: #000000;">Whenever a user clicks Calculate or Calculate all (described below), the calculation job is sent to the Demand Management Workload Queue for prioritization, but before this happens, the system estimates the amount of time required to complete the calculations for each prepack group submitted. If any of those prepack groups are found to require a more significant amount of work than the system can complete immediately, the calculations for those groups will be deferred to a later time – either later that day, overnight, or during weekend processing.</p>

                <p class="warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;WARNING: &lt;/b&gt;">If this occurs, the system will raise a warning message to the user before proceeding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For single prepack group submissions or multiple submissions with the same level of deferrence, the system will raise a message stating the exact nature of the deference for the group(s)<ul><li>Clicking <b>OK</b> will proceed for all</li></ul><ul><li>Clicking <b>Cancel</b> will cancel all</li></ul></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>When multiple groups are submitted and only some will be deferred, or if all are deferred but by different lengths of time, the system will raise a message stating that one or more of the groups submitted will be deferred to whatever the maximum deference is for all groups<ul><li><p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">I submit 3 groups for calculation - one is deferred to later that day, one to overnight, and one to the weekend; the system will warn that one or more prepack groups submitted will be deferred to weekend processing</p></li></ul></li>
                    <li>Clicking <b>OK</b> will proceed for all</li>
                    <li>Clicking <b>Cancel</b> will cancel only those groups that would be deferred but still proceed for any non-deferred groups</li>
