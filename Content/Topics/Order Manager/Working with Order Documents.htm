        <h1>Working with Order Documents </h1>
        <p>The majority of work in Order Manager occurs in the order document viewing area to the right of the Navigation pane. When you access Order Manager, this area displays blank, unless you have created an order using the Create Commitments function from the Receipt Plan view and opted to open the order, or clicked a link to a specific order in the Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard</p>
        <h2>Viewing an Order Document</h2>
        <p>If you display an Order Document, it appears  as a tab with the order name below the top toolbar</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Working with Order Documents_1.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Document Options</h2>
        <p>Right-click anywhere on a document tab to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Close</b>: closes the order document you right-clicked</li>
            <li><b>Close All But This</b>: closes all open order documents except the one you right-clicked; only available when multiple documents are open</li>
            <li><b>Float</b>: converts the document tab to a window that can be sized and positioned on the screen (or other screens, in multiple monitor configurations)</li>
            <li><b>Viewing Order Documents</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Floating can also be achieved by clicking and dragging the document header without right-clicking and selecting Float. After floating, click the document header and drag the document to the desired location. Right click the document header and click Dock as Tabbed Document to return the document to its tabbed position. You can also hover over the directional buttons of the positioning reticle that appears while dragging to see possible docked locations for the floated window.</p>
