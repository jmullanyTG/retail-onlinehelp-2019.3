        <h1>Order Document Details – Break By Size </h1>
        <p>The Break By Size tab allows users to split order line quantities across assigned size curves, or specific sizes selected from curves, based on planned sales and anticipated size inventory across clusters. Sizing analysis is done for all order lines on a document simultaneously.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Save: saves all changes made to the Break By Size information for the order document since the last time it was saved</li>
            <li>Undo: undoes all the changes made to the Break By Size information for the order document since the last time it was saved</li>
            <li>Calculate: calculates the ideal units per size to order by variant and cluster, based on the Size Curve and Selected Sizes for each order line on the order document</li>
