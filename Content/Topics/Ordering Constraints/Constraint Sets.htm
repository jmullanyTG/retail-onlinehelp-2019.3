        <h1>Constraint Sets</h1>
        <p>Constraint sets allow for certain tolerances and rounding rules to be applied to constraints. Constraint sets are managed in a single screen within Demand Management and the creation and maintenance is done within a common wizard. The constraint sets use mathematical rules to help drive the replenishment process. </p>
