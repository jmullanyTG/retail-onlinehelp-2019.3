        <h1>Constraint Groups</h1>
        <p>Constraint groups may be used to selectively apply constraints to inventories within a given filter. Constraint groups are determined by the contents of the standard view uvw_ConstraintGroupName. Within this view, fields are available such as Type Code (order policy indicator), Priority and Criticality (from Inventory Classifications), Product Groups 1-20 (inventory groups), and site groups 1-2.</p>
