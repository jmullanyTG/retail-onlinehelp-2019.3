        <h1>Creating and Editing a Constraint Set</h1>
        <p>Constraint sets may be created from scratch, or cloned from an existing constraint set. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Selecting “new”, “clone”, or “edit” will open the constraint set window. The add/modify constraint set window will launch.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Users may choose to include all items in the selection, or limit the constraint set to specific groups. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Individual constraints may be added to the constraint set, or edited by highlighting them and clicking “modify constraint”. This will launch the “add/modify constraint” window.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Here, users may build individual constraints which are then ordered within the constraint set. Special attention should be given to the rounding settings as they will determine the conflict resolution when generating orders. </p>

        <p>Individual constraint sets may be restricted from modification to certain users.</p>
