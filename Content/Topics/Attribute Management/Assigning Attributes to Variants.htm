        <p>Product attributes can be assigned to variants through Variant Manager</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Filter</b>: user editable drop down; selects a variant filter of products with which to populate the variant manager document</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_2.png" />: this button launches the Maintain Filter dialog, allowing the user to create or import a new filter, or update, delete, or export an existing filter</li>
            <li>Select only some items from the current filter: launches the Item Selection dialog</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>The dialog will list all variants returned by the criteria in the selected filter; select the desired variants to include in the document by clicking the corresponding check boxes in the Selected column</li>
            <li>Items can also be selected using the buttons at the top left<ul><li><img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_4.png" />: selects all rows currently highlighted</li><li><img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_5.png" />: de-selects all rows currently highlighted</li><li><img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_6.png" />: selects ALL rows</li><li><img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_7.png" />: de-selects ALL rows</li></ul></li>

            <li>Typing in the filter row produces a “Starts With” filter effect by default</li>
            <li>Typing % at the start of the value you want to filter for produces a “Contains” type filter instead (as shown above)<ul><li>Choose Column(s): launches the Choose Fields Dialog, in which users can select additional columns to include in the Item Selection view to provide additional context for determining which products are desired</li></ul></li>

        <p>One a variant manager document is open, users can select the variant(s) to be worked with in the top, or Grid, section of the document. Details for the selected variants will appear in the bottom, or Details, section.</p>
        <p>Users can work with a variety of aspects of variants within a variant manager document by clicking the appropriate tab in the Details section. To assign or edit product attributes for the selected variant(s), click the Variant Attribute Management tab.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">both the Grid and Details sections of the view can be toggled on and off by clicking the corresponding buttons (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_11.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 73px;height: 17px;" />) in the upper right of the view.</p>
