        <h1>Practical Application</h1>
        <p>In the assortment planning placeholder or collection visualization screens, users will have access to the attributes tab which slides in from the right hand side of the screen by default. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The attribute families available to select will show up based on the set they were assigned to and ultimately how the attribute set was assigned to a level of the product hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Users will not have two selection options per parameter family</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Single Values</b> – If the parameter family was specified to only allow single values, users will only be able to select from this column, the alternate column will not be editable. Users can click on the drop down and select the attribute value they wish to assign to the placeholder variant or placeholder collection they have currently selected.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Multiple values</b> – If the parameter family was specified to allow multiple values, users will be able to click on the ellipses in the column. A pop-out screen will appear allowing users to select multiple attributes to assign to the placeholder variant or placeholder collection they have currently selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users will be able to select multiple lines to assign attributes and are not required to assign attributes a line at a time in either the placeholder visualization or the collection visualization screen.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that attributes can be associated with both placeholder variants and variants. Attributes can also be maintained on variants in the variant manager module which is discussed in another section of this document. </p>
        <p>Due to the flexibility of the Demand Management assortment planning module and process, it is important for users to manage attributes effectively. By doing so, users will have the ability to slice and dice their assortments effectively. Segmenting the assortment across attributes ensures the correct mix of assortment is being presented to customers.</p>
        <p>In addition to slicing up assortments that have been built, attributes are an effective way to rationalize future assortments. The target creation process allows for attributes to be used in the estimation of the width and depth of future assortments needed to meet financial targets. Users could for instance use the price point range attribute to segment their future assortments using the marginal return curve to estimate the number of options to offer in each price point range.</p>
