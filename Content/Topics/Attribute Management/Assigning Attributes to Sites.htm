        <h1>Assigning Attributes to Sites</h1>
        <p>Product attributes can be assigned to sites through Site Manager</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Sites.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Site Manager is structured and functions very similarly to Variant Manager, with users specifying a site filter, or selecting specific sites from a site filter, to create a document in which to work with those sites.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>One a site manager document is open, users can select the site(s) to be worked with in the top, or Grid, section of the document. Details for the selected sites will appear in the bottom, or Details, section.</p>
        <p>Users can work with a variety of aspects of sites within a variant manager document by clicking the appropriate tab in the Details section. To assign or edit site attributes for the selected site(s), click the Site Attribute Management tab.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">both the Grid and Details sections of the view can be toggled on and off by clicking the corresponding buttons (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Assigning Attributes to Variants_11.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 73px;height: 17px;" />) in the upper right of the view.</p>
