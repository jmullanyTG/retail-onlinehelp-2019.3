        <h1>Attribute Sets</h1>
        <p>Attribute sets define a list of attribute families that are applicable to the set. This function allows users to default a set of attribute families to a product hierarchy level so that each product in that hierarchy level would be eligible to receive the attribute values in question or default certain attribute values if necessary.</p>
        <p>These sets can be used to define attribute values that are only applicable to certain products in the appropriate hierarchy such as sleeve length which may only be applicable to Tops and not to shoe categories.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The attributes sets screen is controlled by two parameters:</p>
        <p><b>Entity Type</b> – This filter will control which attribute sets will be returned to the screen based on the attribute sets which are associated with the entity. Only attribute sets that are associated with the chosen entity will be returned.</p>
        <p>Attribute sets can be associated with specific entities and there are seven entities to which they can be associated, this will allow for certain attribute families to be assigned to the set.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Inventory</b> – Item/location level for attributes that relate to an item at a specific location.</li>
            <li><b>Item master</b> – item across all locations for attributes that are the same for each item across all locations.</li>
            <li><b>Site</b> – site based attributes that can be specified at a site level.</li>
            <li><b>Customer</b> – attributes specific to customers.</li>
            <li><b>Variant</b> – Attributes that are applied to the defined variant. A variant is grouping of items for which plans are created and maintained. An example of this could be a style/color. Variants are used to define real products in assortment planning.</li>
            <li><b>Variant Placeholder</b> – Variant placeholders are created in assortment planning to allow users to generate a plan for a variant that does not exist yet in any external system. Attributes can therefore be assigned to the variant placeholders before they become real variants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Hierarchy</b> – The product hierarchy filter will allow the user to select a single product hierarchy from the list available. This will populate the bottom screen in the view with the appropriate product hierarchy to which an attribute set can be associated. Select the product hierarchy associated with the assortment plan to set defaults for assortment planning.</p>
