        <h1>Report Using Attributes</h1>
        <p>Certain reports are designed to allow attribute values to be included to provide for the rollup of data sliced by the attribute values. One such report is the <b>Assortment Choice Count Report</b> (<b>Plan &gt; Assortment Planning &gt; Dashboard &gt; Assortment Choice Count Report</b>).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In the filter section of the report, users are able to select an attribute family to slice the data by, users will also be able to select the specific attribute values that are relevant to the report.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The returned report will then show the data sliced by the attribute values in question, in this case color group. The counts of variants will also be sliced across regular, promotional and markdown counts although only regular counts are shown above.</p>
        <h2>Using attributes with filters</h2>
        <p>After linking attribute families and values to entities such as variants or item masters users will have the ability to filter the entities using the attribute families in question. Because filters are commonly used throughout the system, this is an important concept.</p>
        <h2>Creating filters or editing filters</h2>
        <p>Users can select to create a new filter or edit an existing filter in the <b>Filters</b> module (<b>Management &gt; Filters</b>) . </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Report Using Attributes_2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>An entity type must be selected to ensure that the appropriate attribute families can be returned and used in the filter.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Report Using Attributes_3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>All available attribute families associated with the selected entity will be available and multiple attribute families can be selected to further refine the attribute in line with filter creation criteria.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Report Using Attributes_4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Users will now be able to select single or multiple values related to the attribute family selected</p>
