        <h1>Layout</h1>
        <p>The Slot Set Layout view provides a more visual representation of the placement and composition of Promotions in an Event. A visual layout replaces the Slot list grid, while the Promotion and Geography panes are stacked on the right-hand side of the screen as opposed to being positioned across the bottom of the page as they are in the List view. Access to this screen depends on the user’s rights.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Depending on the Global Policy ‘Promotion Double Click Action’ setting, double clicking on an assigned Promotion in the Slot Set will load the Promotion in either a window or in the Promotions solution.</p>
        <h2>Headers</h2>
        <p>Selecting the page header icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Headers.png" /> at the top of the Slot Set Layout view will display the Position, Item Display Format, and Space name for each Slot. An example of a Space name is indicated by a red box in the following image. Also, hover text is available if the slot is too small to show the entire header.</p>

        <h2>Slot dimensions</h2>
        <p>Selecting the right angle ruler icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Slot dimensions.png" /> at the top of the Slot Set Layout view will hide the Item Display Formats on the Slot Set and display the Slot dimensions and the Slot’s proportion relative to the Slot Set.</p>

        <h2>Slot items</h2>
        <p>If the selected Slot has more than Promotion, the Slot Items drop down list is displayed. The user can select which Promotion in the Slot to display in Layout.</p>
