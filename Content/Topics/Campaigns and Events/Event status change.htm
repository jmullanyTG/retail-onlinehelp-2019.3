        <p>The Slot Sets will inherit the new Status even if the Slot Set Status State is not ‘Complete’ or is currently overridden. The Status State will be reset to ‘In Progress’ for all Slot Sets.</p>
        <p>The Event Workflow will advance to the next Status and the Event Schedule will reflect the Status change.</p>
