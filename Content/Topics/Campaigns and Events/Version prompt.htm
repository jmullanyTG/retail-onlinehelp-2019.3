        <p>The user can toggle <b>Version Prompt</b>. When activated, the user is prompted to select which Geography to associate with the Promotion, every time the user clicks <b>Add to Event</b>. By selecting only a subset of Geographies for a Promotion, the excluded Geographies remain available to associate with a different Promotion and the Slot is not considered fully assigned. <b>Version Prompt</b> may be disabled at any time.</p>
