        <h1>Slot set status override</h1>
        <p>In some situations (e.g. to provide additional permissions or to remove permissions), it may be necessary to change a specific Slot Set to a previous Status, different from the rest of the Event Slot Sets. The user can select a previous Slot Set Status by clicking <b>Status Override</b>, selecting an option from the drop down list and clicking Ok. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the modifications to the Slot Set have been completed, the Slot Set may be returned to its normal Status by selecting ‘Complete &amp; Advance’ from the Slot Set Status drop down list and clicking <b>Save</b>. This will push the Slot Set to the current Event Workflow Status.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> If the Event Status is changed before the Status Override is complete, the Slot Set inherits the new Status and the Status State is reset to ‘In Progress’.</p>
        <p>The Event Schedule will be updated to reflect the that the Slot Set has a Status State of ‘Pending (Override)’ for the current Status and a Status State of ‘In Progress (Override)’ for the Status that the Slot Set was reverted back to.</p>
