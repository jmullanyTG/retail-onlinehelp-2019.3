        <h1>Event Detail </h1>
        <p>The Event Detail screen is displayed immediately after creation or if an existing Event is opened from the List or Calendar view for review or modification. Depending on the user’s permissions configured for the Event’s current Workflow Status, this screen provides the ability to review or modify the Event Header information, Slot Sets, Geographies, Budget and Composition.</p>

        <p>The screen consists of the Event Navigation Pane on the left and the workspace area on the right. The Event Navigation Pane displays the Event and its Slot Sets in a tree style navigation. Selecting an Event in the tree refreshes the workspace area displaying the Geography, Budget and Workbench tabs along with several buttons. </p>
        <h2>Selecting a Slot Set</h2>
        <p>Event planning activities mostly occur at the Slot Set level. Selecting a Slot Set loads the Slot Set Pane below the tree and refreshes the workspace to provide access to the Promotion menu (View, Content) and the following: List, Layout, Versions. </p>
