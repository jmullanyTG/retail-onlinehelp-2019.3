        <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>When a new filter is created, its cache is built immediately. </li>
            <li>Rebuilding filter caches is an extremely important task and should, in most instances, be run on a daily basis. This may take a considerable amount of time during the overnight run and will depend on the volume of data and the number of filters which need to be rebuilt. </li>
            <li>Custom code should no longer reference <span class="code_sample">tbl_FilterCache</span>, because population of <span class="code_sample">tbl_FilterCache</span> is optional when filters are rebuilt. </li>
            <li><span class="code_sample">Udf_ApplyFilter</span> has been officially scheduled for deprecation and should not be called.</li>
