        <h2>To modify a Price Action</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Within the Price Manager screen, click the <b>Actions</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Double-click a <b>Price Action</b> in the Price Actions grid.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Modify the fields in the <b>Edit Price Action</b> dialog as required.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">The Price Strategies available to be selected are filtered based on the Price Action Strategy’s restricted User and Role access. If a Price Action Strategy was selected in the past that is no longer valid, the system will retain the 'restricted' Price Action Strategy. However, once a different Price Action Strategy is selected, the 'restricted' Price Action Strategy will no longer be available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Ok</b>.</p>
                <p>The Price Action screen will be refreshed. If a new Strategy or Start Date is selected, the system will ensure that the Price and Cost values are still valid.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Calculations and validations</h2>
        <p>Based on the Pricing Strategy selected, you may be required to enter required values before the system allows calculations and validations to occur. Enter all required fields in the Price Strategy Variable grid (top right) and click <b>Calculate</b> otherwise click <b>Save</b> to calculate and evaluate at a later time.</p>
