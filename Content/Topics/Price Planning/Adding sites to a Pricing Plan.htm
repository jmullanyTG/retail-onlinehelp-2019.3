        <p>To add an existing Site to a Pricing Plan:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Add Site</b> in the toolbar of the <b>Sites</b> grid.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Add a Site to an Existing Pricing Site Cluster</b> dialog, click the drop down arrow in the Site Filter field to choose a set of Sites.</li>
            <li>Optionally, to return a subset of Sites from the Site filter select the check box labeled <b>Select only some items from the current filter</b>.<ol><li><p>On the <b>Site Selection</b> dialog, select the check boxes for the Sites to be added to the new Site Cluster.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> Only those Sites meeting the filter criteria and not already associated to the Pricing Plan’s pre-configured Site Clusters display.</p></li><li><p>Click <b>Ok</b>.</p><p>If the newly added Site does not share the same currency the system re-uses the Site Cluster name by currency (for example, EMEA(GBP) and EMEA(EUR)).</p></li></ol></li>
            <li>Click <b>Ok</b> on the <b>Add a Site to an Existing Pricing Site Cluster</b> dialog.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Ok</b> on the confirmation popup window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the <b>Activate the New Site(s) to Existing Action(s)</b> window displays, then select the Price Actions, not already exported, to include the new Site.</p>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> The <b>Activate the New Site Cluster(s) to Existing Action(s)</b> window does not display if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>there are no future Price Actions</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>all future Price Actions are in a core status</p>
                        <p>A core Status is a Status that is owned by the system and is not user configurable. Core statuses do not display in Workflow. The following are core statuses:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preparing Data for Export</li>
                            <li>Ready For Export</li>
                            <li>Exported</li>
                            <li>Export Confirmed</li>
                            <li>Exported With Errors</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If required, click Save on the <b>Activate the New Site Cluster(s) to Existing Action(s)</b> window.</p>
                <p>Upon clicking <b>Save</b>, the Site is added to the Site Cluster and associated Sites are added to Price Actions as Included and the Pricing Strategy Variable default values are applied to the new Site and pushed down to Variants\Sites. Also, the system marks the following as Calculation Required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Site Cluster Variant Sites</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Site Cluster Variants </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Price Action</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Price Action's Plan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a Price Action has gone into a calculating state, the system will add the Site Cluster and associated Sites as Excluded and display a dialog indicating that not all Price Actions were updated.</p>
                <p>If a Price Action exists where the Site Cluster is Excluded, then the system includes the new Site as Excluded to the excluded Site Cluster.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
