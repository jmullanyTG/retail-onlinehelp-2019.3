        <h1>Modify a Price Strategy Rule</h1>
        <p>Modifications can be made directly to the Price Strategy Rule grid. Modifications cannot be made to the Rule Type and Rule Calculation fields. Modification of a Price Strategy Rule will cause associated Price Actions to be marked for recalculation/evaluation, unless already exported.</p>
        <p>Clicking <b>Save</b> will save any modifications. Click <b>Cancel</b> to discard any modifications.  </p>
        <p>
            <b>Modifying the Priority Order</b>
        </p>

        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">Priority Order 1 – 7 and you modify #5 to become #2</p>
        <ul>
