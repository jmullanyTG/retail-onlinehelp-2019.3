        <h1>Price Strategies</h1>
        <p>Price Planning Strategies provide you with the ability to define Pricing Strategy Rules calculation and validations that the system will use to provide adjusted pricing across the multiple needs of the retailer’s omni-channel distribution points.</p>
        <p>The Rule grid (top right) defines the priority for the validations and calculations per corporate standards as well as defining severity levels of Validations. The Variable grid at the bottom lists all variables used in the Price Strategy and allows defaults to be entered (i.e. user input only). </p>
