        <h1>Exclude Products from the Price Action</h1>
        <p>Selection of a Price Action, in the Price Actions screen, will populate the Price Action Detail grid with the applicable Variants. To exclude a Variant, mark the check box adjacent to the Variant and click <b>Exclude</b>.</p>
        <p>Once the exclusion is confirmed, the system will display the excluded Variant(s) with a strike through. Excluding Variants from the Price Action Detail Grid will cause removal across all configured Sites meaning that the system will not implement any Price Strategy calculations nor validations for any Products within the Variant. </p>
