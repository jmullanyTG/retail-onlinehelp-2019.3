        <p>To delete a Pricing Action, select it within a Pricing Plan’s ‘Actions’ tab, click <b>Delete</b> and confirm the system warning. If <b>Delete</b> is not enabled you do not have permissions to delete the Price Action based on the Price Action’s current status, if workflow is configured, or if the Pricing has already been exported.</p>
