        <h1>Modifying the products included in a Pricing Plan</h1>
        <p>To add products to a Pricing Plan, click <b>Add</b> on the <b>Pricing Plan Variants</b> grid. The solution provides two methods to identify additional products: using filter criteria or using the system clipboard. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Adding products from a filter</h2>
        <p>Clicking <b>Add &gt; from Filter</b> displays a filter window in which you can choose an existing filter or click the <b>Maintain Filters</b> icon to create a new filter. Once a filter is selected, click <b>Ok</b> to append any new products to the existing product listing and then click <b>Save</b> to commit changes.</p>
        <p>If active Pricing Actions exist, the system allows you to apply the new products using the Action’s Summary level entered values. If you are unable to add products, the Pricing Action may be in a status that does not allow modification with your rights.</p>
        <h2>Adding products from the Clipboard</h2>
        <p>You can add products by selecting the right-click menu option <b>Copy Column Cell(s)</b> in the Product grid and then selecting <b>Add &gt; from Clipboard</b>. </p>
        <p>The system validates all entries and logs all failed products for investigation. Successful entries are added to the Pricing Plan and you can act immediately on the new products by adding to a Pricing Action. </p>

        <h2>Remove products from the Pricing Plan<br></br></h2>
        <p>To remove products from the Pricing Plan, click <b>Remove</b> on the Pricing Plan Variant grid. The solution provides two methods to remove products: manual selection or using the system clipboard.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Manual Selection</p>
        <p>To remove products from the Pricing Plan, select and mark the check box adjacent to the appropriate products in the Pricing Plan Variant grid and click <b>Remove Selected</b>.</p>
        <p>The system will not allow removal of products from the Pricing Plan if the products are being used in a Pricing Action.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Remove from Clipboard</p>
        <p>You can remove products directly with the <b>Remove from Clipboard</b> button. The copied list should have one product (i.e. Variant or Item Master, global policy) per line.</p>
        <p>The system validates all entries and logs all failed products for investigation. For successful entries and upon confirmation, the system removes the products and recalculate the Pricing Actions.</p>
