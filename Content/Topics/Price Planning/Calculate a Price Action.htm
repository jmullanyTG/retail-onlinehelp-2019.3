        <h1>Calculate a Price Action</h1>
        <p>Once the Price Action has been configured to your satisfaction, click <b>Calculate</b> to have the system execute the Price Strategy’s configured prioritized calculations and validations, which are run at the lowest level, and displayed as a minimum and maximum in the Price Action Summary grid. </p>
        <p>If there are any differences in entered variable information the ‘exception’ check box will be marked for easy identification. To view lower level calculated pricing information, click <b>Detail</b> for the appropriate Variant details.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> You will not be able to edit the Price Action (e.g. exclusions of Variants/Sites nor enterable Price Strategy fields) while it is being calculated and validated by the system.</p>
