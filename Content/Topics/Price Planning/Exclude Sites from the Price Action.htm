        <h1>Exclude Sites from the Price Action</h1>
        <p>Selection of a Price Action, in the Price Actions screen, will populate the Price Action Detail grid with the applicable Sites associated to the selected currency. To exclude a Site, mark the check box adjacent to the Site and click <b>Exclude</b>.</p>
        <p>Once the exclusion is confirmed, the system will display the excluded Site(s) with a strike through. Excluding Sites from the Price Action Detail Grid will cause removal pricing for all Variants meaning that the system will not implement any Price Strategy calculations nor validations against Products for the excluded Site(s). </p>
