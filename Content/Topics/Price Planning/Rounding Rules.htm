        <h1>Rounding Rules</h1>
        <p>Rounding Rules allow you to create grouped Rounding Criteria, to be applied to a Pricing Strategy Calculation to conform to corporate price rounding standards. The solution can be configured with both ‘general’ rounding as well as rounding with ‘price endings’.</p>
        <p>‘Price Ending’ rounding refers to selection a numeric position and rounding it up/down/closest to the configured price ending value based on the preceding numeric position value.</p>
