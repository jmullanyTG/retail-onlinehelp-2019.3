        <h1>Modify Pricing at lower levels</h1>
        <p>Data entered in the Price Strategy Variable grid populates to all Price Action Variants and Sites included in the Price Action (except excluded). To specify different values, from what is configured at the Price Action level (i.e. Price Strategy Variable grid), modifications may be made at three lower levels: Action Summary, Item Detail and Location.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">&#160;The following grids each have a column labeled <b>Validation</b>. This column uses icons to denote Validation failures and whether the Validation failures have been reviewed or not. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Price Planning Home Screen.htm">Price Planning Home Screen</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Modifying values in the Action Summary grid</h2>
        <p>Values are populated down from the Price Action Variable grid down to the Action Summary in which you have the ability to modify those values. Enter a new value for the applicable Variant variables within the <b>Action Summary</b> grid. Modifying a value for a specific Variant will apply the modified entry to all lower levels (i.e. Item and Item Location Detail). The system will also denote any differences within a level by shading the cell. Lower level differences will be noted by a marked <b>Exception</b> check box. <br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Price Planning/Modify Pricing at lower levels.png" /></p>
        <h2>Excluding or re-including products at the Variant, Item Master, and Inventory levels</h2>
        <p>You can exclude products at the Variant, Item Master, and Inventory levels using the <b>Advanced Product Exclusions</b> dialog. Multiple selections at a product parent level displays the summary of children at the lower levels for modification.</p>
        <p>To display the <b>Advanced Product Exclusions</b> dialog, click the <b>Advanced Exclusions</b> button.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> The <b>Variant</b> grid and <b>Item</b> grid display by default. Click <b>View Location</b> to display the <b>Item Location</b> grid which lists all Price Action inventories associated to the selected Site Cluster. Select <b>View Items</b> to hide or display the <b>Items</b> grid.</p>
