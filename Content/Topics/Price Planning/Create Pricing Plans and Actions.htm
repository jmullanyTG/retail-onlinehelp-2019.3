        <h1>Price Actions</h1>
        <p>
        Price Actions may be configured with the same, or a subset of, products and sites from the Pricing Plan to apply a Pricing Strategy (i.e. validations and calculations with rounding rules) to generate a new retail sale price for a specific date, forward. While the start date, products and sites will be limited by the configured Pricing Plan, they can be further excluded at the Price Action level. Any manual entry entered at the Price Action Cluster or variant summary level will be pushed down to the individual product/site level. The solution also provides the ability to edit specific sites and individual products within a Variant Group. </p>
        <p>Validation failures are denoted using Validation failure icons in the <b>Validation</b> column. The icons indicate whether the Validation failures have been reviewed or not.
