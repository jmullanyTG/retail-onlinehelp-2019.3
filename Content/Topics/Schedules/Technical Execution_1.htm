        <p>Schedule sets are stored as “Almanacs” within the database; they may be found in <span class="code_sample">tbl_Common_Schedule_Almanac</span>. Schedule relationships are stored in <span class="code_sample">tbl_Common_Schedule_AlmanacLink</span>. This table also holds the behavior as ScheduleMode and the priority. For a particular schedule set (almanac), the priority 0 will define the highest priority, and its associated ScheduleMode will dictate the behavior of all non-specified dates. </p>
