        <h1>Schedule Types</h1>
        <p>Demand Management lets you create multiple types of schedules for sites and DCs. Each affects the lead time that Demand Management factors in when determining the date an order needs to be placed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Destination Ship Schedule</b>: Incorporates allocations wherein product is shipped directly from the manufacturer to destination stores.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Drop Ship Schedule</b> - Use for direct supplier orders that do not follow your normal shipping and receiving schedules. </li>
            <li><b>Order Processing Schedule</b> - This schedule sets the dates when staff is available to process orders at store or DC. It is used to derive the actual number of lead time days needed to process orders at the site. </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Outbound Handling Schedule</b>: When a DC cannot accommodate an order request the day it was placed, outbound handling schedules may be applied to better represent the realistic ship date from the DC.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Receiving Schedule</b> – Receiving schedules set the dates on which a store or DC may receive stock. These schedules can ensure busy stores receive stock shipments during times with less foot traffic, or when staff is available for processing. </li>
            <li><b>Shipping Schedule</b> – Shipping schedules set the dates on which an order may be placed against a store or DC. It is assumed that any location is able to ship on the same day that an order is placed.</li>
            <li><b>Transportation Schedule</b> – Transportation schedules set the dates on which transportation of stock to a store or DC is available ("truck" schedules, etc.). When calculating lead times for shipments to a receiving site, Demand Management uses the destination site's transportation schedule to determine what days transportation to the destination site is available. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> A schedule set can be used in any type of schedule. </p>
