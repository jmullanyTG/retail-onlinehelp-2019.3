        <h1>Essential Business Concepts</h1>
        <p>How ordering and receiving schedules are applied to suppliers will affect ordering behavior in different ways. Not all suppliers will require specific schedule sets, but they may be used to restrict how order dates are produced by the Demand Management Replenishment Engine when the desired behavior is to align ordering with logistical constraints. Demand Management is, at its core, an inventory optimization tool; application and integration related any real-world logistical constraints may hinder sales, stocking levels, or general availability. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ordering Schedule</b> – The ordering schedule determines the dates on which an order may be placed with a supplier. It does not control supplier shipping dates.</li>
            <li><b>Receiving Schedule</b> – The receiving schedule determines the days on which a supplier is allowed to make a delivery to any location within the network. It must align with a site receiving schedule in order for the site to receive any stock. </li>
