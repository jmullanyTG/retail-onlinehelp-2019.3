        <h1>Frequency</h1>
        <p>For recurring schedules, users may define the frequency with which the schedule trigger will occur. Each occurrence option is accompanied by specific controls to determine eligibility within the period type.</p>
        <h2>Daily</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Recurs Every _ Day(s)</b> – The frequency, in days. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Weekly</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Recurs Every _ Weeks On –</b> The frequency of weeks. A schedule designed to trigger every week should be set to “1”, and bi-weekly, set to “2”. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Single days of the week may be selected individually or several days may be selected.</p>
        <h2>Monthly</h2>
        <p>Monthly schedules may be set up either based on a numerical date modifier or on a day of the week. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Day _ of</b>&#160; - Allows users to set the day of the month on which the schedule will trigger. Values over 31 will be resolved to 31. Any values over 28 may risk not occurring in a specified month (check resolution details for confirmation). </li>
            <li><b>The _ _ of</b> – Allows users to select a day of the week and the sequential occurrence of that day. Users may choose the first, second, third, fourth, or last specified weekday which falls within a month. </li>
            <li><b>Of Every _ Month(s)</b> – The frequency of months. A schedule designed to trigger every month should be set to “1”, and bi-monthly, set to “2”. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Yearly </h2>
        <p>Yearly (or annual) schedules may be set up based on a numerical date modifier, a month or week of the year, or for a specific day of the year. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>...On Day _ of That Year</b> – A numerical value between 1-366 which will specify a date. </li>
            <li><b>…On _ _ of That Year</b> – Users may select either month or week and an associated numerical modifier. This will be based on the selected start date, so users expecting a result similar to the Gregorian calendar should enter a start date of January 1st. Selecting “Month” and “2” would trigger the schedule on February 1st (with a start date of January 1st). Selecting “Week” and “13” will trigger the schedule on March 20th. Weeks are consider to start on Sundays. </li>
            <li><b>…On day _ of Month _</b> - Users may select a specific day of the year on which to trigger the schedule (e.g. on day 4 of month July). </li>
        </ul>
