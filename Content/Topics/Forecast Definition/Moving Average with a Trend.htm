        <h1>Moving Average with a Trend</h1>
        <p>One disadvantage to using a moving average is that it does not deal well with trends or seasonality. The Demand Management forecasting engine combats this with the modified method of the moving average with a trend. It accomplishes this prior to averaging by performing a detrend of the data, which is then reapplied after the average is performed. The moving average with a trend will have a slope.</p>
