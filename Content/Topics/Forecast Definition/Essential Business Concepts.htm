        <p>Modes and methods together will define the forecast base. It is sometimes referred to simply as “forecast method”, but ignoring the mode misses a large part of how a forecast is generated for a particular series. There are three different types of modes used in Demand Management, two for quantitative methods and one for the naïve approach.</p>
        <p>The classification of forecasting methods can be broken down into two distinct groupings. The group called&#160;<b>averaging methods</b>&#160;conform to the conventional understanding of what an average is – namely, equally weighted observations. The second group of methods applies an unequal set of weights to past data and because the weights typically decay in an exponential manner from the most recent to the most distant data point, the methods are known as&#160;<b>exponential smoothing&#160;methods</b>. Demand Management utilizes these two types of forecasting methods in addition to linear regression and intermittent demand. </p>
