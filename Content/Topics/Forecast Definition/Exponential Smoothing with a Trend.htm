        <h1>Exponential Smoothing with a Trend</h1>
        <p>This method is similar to exponential smoothing, but will perform a detrend of the data and then reapply the trend after the forecast is calculated. This method will actually use the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method and requires the application of a second smoothing constant, β. The smoothing of the trend will require the use of the trend factor β, which will also be a value between 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Adjusting β to a value closer to 1 will tell the forecasting engine that you have more confidence in your recent data points and to give a higher consideration to them when calculating your forecast.</p>
