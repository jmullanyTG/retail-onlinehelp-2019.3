        <h1>No Confidence</h1>
        <p>The <b>No Confidence</b> processor rule is unique in that it does not follow many of the other restrictions placed on processor rules. The <b>No Confidence</b> rule takes a complete copy of the historical series on a seasonal level and applies it to future periods based on the underlying forecasting method. </p>
        <p>There are no default parameters for this rule. </p>
