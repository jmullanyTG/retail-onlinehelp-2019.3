        <h1>Trend</h1>
        <p>The Trend processor rule is commonly used in several forecast methods. It is used to “DeTrend” and then “ReTrend” the data series. What this means is that the pre-processor takes any apparent trend and remove it from the series, then re-adds it during the post-processor.</p>
        <p>The only default parameter value for the <b>Trend</b> processor rule is the slope.</p>
