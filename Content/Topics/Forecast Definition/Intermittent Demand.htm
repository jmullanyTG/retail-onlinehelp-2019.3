        <h1>Intermittent Demand</h1>
        <h2>Croston Intermittent Demand</h2>
        <p>The Croston model is specifically designed for data sets where the demand for any given period is often zero and the exact timing of the next order is not known. Low-level data (e.g., SKU by customer) or spare parts often exhibit this kind of demand pattern. This method works by combining a smoothed estimate of the average demand for periods that have demand with a smoothed estimate of the average demand interval. The forecasts are not magic (they won’t tell you when the next order will be placed), however, they often yield a better forecast for expected demand than other time series approaches.</p>
