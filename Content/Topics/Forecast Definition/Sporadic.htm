        <h1>Sporadic</h1>
        <p>The <b>Sporadic</b> processor rule will only be applicable to data sets with intermittent sales data that would use a predictive method such as Croston Intermittent Demand. The sporadic processor would average the number of data points between zeros, add in (and later remove in the post-processor stage!) false data  to allow the Engine to forecast a smooth line.</p>
