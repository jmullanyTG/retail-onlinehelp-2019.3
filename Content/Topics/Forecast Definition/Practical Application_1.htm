        <p>Any interaction with the survey rules will come in one of two places within Demand Management: </p>

            <li>The forecast viewer will display a specific trend rule if it has disqualified the method from the forecasting tournament. This functionality is described in the forecasts documentation.</li>
            <li>The “edit method definition” window within the forecast definition module. </li>
        </ol>
