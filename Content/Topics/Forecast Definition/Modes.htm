        <h1>Modes</h1>
        <p>There are three types of modes which will relate to the base of the forecast. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Static</b> – As you project, the forecasting engine takes the most recent real data points. </li>
            <li><b>Dynamic</b> – The forecasting engine will take the projected data points and apply them to the forecast as if they were real data points. </li>
            <li><b>Naïve (no confidence)</b> – This approach will determine that the forecast for any period equals the previous period’s actual value.  </li>
        </ul>
