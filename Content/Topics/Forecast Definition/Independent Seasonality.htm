        <h1>Independent Seasonality</h1>
        <p>The <b>Independent Seasonality</b> processor rule applies a smoothing function to the seasonality using a smoothing parameter. This is determined by the smoothing window.</p>
        <p>The smoothing window is the determining factor in the calculation of the smoothing parameter. It will take a reading of a specified number of historical points and use that data to determine a smoothing factor. The number of points in the smoothing window should always be odd, and it is important to understand that the greater the number of points chosen, the smoother the line will be. The default value is 3. The slope is an additional default parameter.</p>
