        <h1>Holt-Winters Multiplicative</h1>
        <p>The Holt-Winters multiplicative method is very similar to the exponential smoothing with a trend and seasonality method with the distinct difference that the seasonality is included. This method will still require the input of α, β, and γ smoothing factors and a separate seasonality parameter, which will be a value indicating the number of periods in a season.</p>
