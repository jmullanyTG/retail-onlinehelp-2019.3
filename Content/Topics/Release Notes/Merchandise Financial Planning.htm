        <h2>Viewing Assortment Plan data within the Merchandise Financial Planning module <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-62904</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-59322</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Two new comparison types let users review Assortment Plan data within the Merchandise Financial Planning module. Users can now easily reference Assortment Plan data while working on Financial Plans without having to go back and forth between two screens. This helps ensure that Financial Plans and Assortment Plans align for accurate forecasting and buying. The new comparison types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>vs. Assortment Plan</b> - compares the plan's metrics against a particular Assortment Plan. </li>
            <li><b>vs. Assortment Plan Snapshot</b> - compare the plan's metrics against a particular snapshot of an Assortment Plan.</li>
        </ul>
