        <h1>Engine</h1>
        <p>Demand Management version 2019.3 introduces a new solution called <b>Engine Template</b> that provides a central source of managing engine templates so that users can easily create and update templates in a single place. </p>
        <p>There are two default task detail templates that can be used by the Engine to run items requested by the user without requiring any input from the user about the configuration. These templates are configured by editing a <b>Replenish Task</b> dialog or a <b>Forecast Task</b> dialog and saving the updated configuration into the template.</p>
        <p>The purpose of these templates is to allow processes that should not require user input to be able to create engine tasks with appropriate predefined settings. </p>
        <p><b>Engine Template</b> is located under the <b>Management</b> tab.</p>
