        <h1>Inventory Policy</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Inventory Policy solution. </p>
        <h2>Adding a lead time days value to a Policy Task to indicate Outbound handling lead time <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-62980, 62979, 62978</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Within the Logistics section of the Inventory Policy blade within Inventory Manager, a new field labeled <b>Outbound Handling Lead Time</b> allows for the input of a lead time days value to account for the need of certain DCs to prepare stock on hand for shipment. In instances where a DC may not be able to accommodate an order request the day it was placed, an outbound handling lead time may be applied to better represent the realistic ship date from the DC.</p>
        <p>A new check box labeled <b>Reset to Default</b> resets the value in the <b>Outbound Handling Lead Time</b> field to null within the Inventory Policy Task screen. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-64673</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
