        <h1>New Features and Enhancements</h1>
        <p>The Demand Management 2019.3.2.0 Service Pack includes the following new features and enhancements:</p>
        <h2>Assortment Planning</h2>
        <p>With the new system policy <b>Reference Sales Override Values for Carryover Sales in Target Creation</b>, users now have the ability to choose whether to use the system-generated sales plan or the user revised sales plan within Target Creation. For more information, see <b>System Policies</b>.</p>
        <p>To improve consistency, the <b>Stock To Sales</b> metrics in the <b>Sales Plan</b> view have been updated to calculate in the same way as the <b>Stock To Sales</b> metrics in the <b>Top Down Sales Plan</b> view.</p>
        <p>The calculation is:</p>
        <p>Leaf level Stock Units to Sales Units = BOP Units / Sales Units</p>
        <p>Aggregating stock to sales over time = (First period BOP + all periods' incremental incoming stock) / Sum of Sales Units</p>
        <p>Aggregating metrics within a period = Sum of BOP / Sum of Sales Units = Geography / Product Total STS</p>
        <h2>Replenishment Engine</h2>
        <p>The Replenishment Engine has been updated for <b>Constraint Service Optimization</b>. A new system policy was created: <b>Run Supply Chain Constrained Process</b>. This allows the engine to run in unconstrained and then run our new constraint service.</p>
        <p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">This only works for supply chains with <i>NO ALTERNATES</i>.</p>
        <h2>System Policies
