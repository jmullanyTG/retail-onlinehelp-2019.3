        <h1>Replenishment Overview</h1>
        <p>Replenishment is the process of ordering stock over time to meet anticipated demand. </p>
        <p>In Demand Management, the replenishment process is driven automatically according to the following inputs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The forecasted daily demand for each of your items at each of your locations.</li>
            <li>The projected daily stock on hand at your store locations and distribution centers.</li>
            <li>The replenishment-related ordering parameters defined for your items.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Demand Management uses this information to automatically create the best possible replenishment strategy for your organization, which optimizes the orders available in the Order Manager. These orders ensure that stock arrives at your distribution centers and individual store locations just in time to meet anticipated demand, with the minimum required overhead.</p>
        <p>The Demand Management replenishment process is as follows:</p>

        </p>
        <p>In this process, Demand Management's statistical forecasts predict the unconstrained daily demand for each of your items at each of your locations. Before orders can be placed; however, the ordering rules set up for each item must be considered. Factors such as minimum and maximum order quantities, lead times, supply chains, etc. all influence how orders are optimized by Demand Management. </p>
        <p>After Demand Management creates an optimal replenishment plan for your items based on the demand forecast and replenishment parameters, it creates the orders in the Order Manager.</p>
        <p>Although the replenishment process is automated and happens largely behind-the-scenes, you can monitor ongoing replenishment status for your items through the Inventory Manager.</p>
