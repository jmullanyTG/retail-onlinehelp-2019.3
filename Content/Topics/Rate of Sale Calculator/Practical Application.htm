        <h1>Practical Application</h1>
        <p>The Rate of Sale Calculator allows for quick and easy modeling of scenarios, both simple and complex. Using these scenarios, users can develop realistic estimations of the performance of an item in a given cluster during a specific time frame, but this information can also be shared with other areas of the organization such as buyers, merchants, sourcing teams etc. dynamically to establish confidence in these estimates as they relate to planning and executing within a merchandising organization.&#160; </p>
        <p>As with any flexible tool, there is a learning curve to understanding the calculator and how to use it to its fullest. Here are a few tips to help you maximize its usefulness as a regular part of the assortment planning process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Modeling After a Single Variant</b> – one of the most common of all situations is the need to estimate demand for a new item based on a similar item’s history. While the easiest way is via the Like Style option in the Add Placeholders dialog in Assortment Planning (see Assortment Planning Standard Documentation &gt; Line Visualization), using the ROS Calculator may yield more accurate results, because of the added data cleansing. To achieve this, simply create a product filter with the single item you want to model after, or select a filter containing the desired item and exclude all other items using the Scenario Detail view, and calculate and apply the scenario as described above. This will also allow you to see both the cleansed and uncleaned rates of sale to understand potential differences in using both methods for similar situations in the future.</li>
            <li><b>Modeling After Multiple Variants</b> – users may encounter situations where they need to add one or more new items to a product level or business segment quickly after a Target Creation scenario has already been used to Smart Start an assortment plan. Users may not even have specific product images from which to gauge potential performance and only a vague idea of what the expected return will be on each. By creating a scenario using a product filter for the entire product level or group the new items will live within, users will be presented with an array of options, based on top performers, bottom performers, and multiple bands in between, from which to choose. Using the Scenario Detail view, you can see which variants ranked into each performance band and even make exclusions to fine-tune the results by band.</li>
            <li><b>Modeling Promotional Variants</b> – some organizations add a number of promo-only items during peak business seasons, such as for the Christmas holiday. To more accurately model the potential demand for such items, users have a variety of options available. If similar promotions were run in the past and the relevant items are attributed for easy identification, simply creating a scenario based on a product filter for items of the proper attribute may be sufficient. More likely, though, the items are simply part of a larger product level or group, but this isn’t a problem. Simply use a product filter for the relevant variants, select the Promo sales type, excluding all others, and set the time frame to the period the like-promo ran. For even more accuracy, if you have a defined Price Type for promotional pricing, you can use this in conjunction with the Min Price, Max Price, and/or Max Price Discount parameters to narrow your data pool to only variants whose promotional pricing fell within a certain price range or percent discount. These same methods can be applied when modeling rates of sale for markdown items.</li>
            <li><b>Applying Rates of Sale to Collections</b> – if you are adding an entire new collection (most commonly, a single style in multiple colors) to your assortment plan, you don’t have to model each placeholder within the collection separately to achieve a good rate of sale estimate for each. Particularly in cases where the specific variants that will be assigned to the placeholders in a collection are not yet known, applying a rate of sale to the entire collection may be the better way to go. Applying by collection uses the rate of sale you’ve selected for each cluster but then uses a multiplier derived from the marginal return curve (see Assortment Planning Standard Documentation &gt; Target Creation &gt; Rationalization) created during scenario calculation to determine the diminishing rate of return for each successive placeholder within the collection. It is a well-known fact that not all colors of a given style perform exactly the same, and since the rate of sale tiering that occurs in collection-level applications of rates of sale is based on actual historical performance of variants within their respective collections, this method is likely to yield a more accurate result without users having to guess at the specifics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote"> There are a few differences in the selections for Allocations type scenarios versus the Assortment Planning type scenarios referenced above. For more information related to application of the Rate of Sale Calculator within Allocations,  see the <b>Allocation User</b> guide document. </p>
