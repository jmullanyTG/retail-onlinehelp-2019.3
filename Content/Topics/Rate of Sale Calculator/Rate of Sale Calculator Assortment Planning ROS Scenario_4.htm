        <h1>Rate of Sale Calculator â€“ Applying a ROS Scenario</h1>
        <p>The third component is where the user applies the results of a Rate of Sale scenario.&#160; Users select a product filter to identify potential placeholders/variants to apply the results to. Users have the ability to apply the ROS results to multiple placeholders/variants and/or collections directly in this tool. The application of ROS in this view is integrated with the assortment planning module, so once the user has applied the results, the demand plan for the items selected will be adjusted to reflect the ROS values that have been applied.</p>
