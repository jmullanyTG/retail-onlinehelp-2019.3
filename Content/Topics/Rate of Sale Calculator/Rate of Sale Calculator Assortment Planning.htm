        <h1>Rate of Sale Calculator Stand-Alone module</h1>
        <p>The <b>Rate of Sale Calculator</b> module helps users determine how much, in units or revenue, a particular placeholder or collection might sell per site per week. All of the functionality essential to Assortment Planning is available in this stand-alone version of the tool. </p>
        <p>A scaled down version also exists directly in the Assortment Planning module.&#160; The stand-alone version is accessed via <b>Execute &gt; Demand &gt; Rate of Sale Scenario</b>.</p>

        <p>There are three main options in determining rate of sale for a placeholder/collection in planning demand with assortment planning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Smart Start</b>: this method leverages a marginal return curve to determine rates of sale for each placeholder required to fulfill a target that is set in Target Creation</li>
            <li><b>Like Style Modeling</b>: manually create placeholders/collections and model those choices after historical like items</li>
            <li><b>Rate of Sale Calculator</b>: using this tool after a user has either smart started their assortment or manually created placeholders/collections, users can refine assortment plans by using historical data to determine an appropriate rate of sale to apply to placeholders/collections within them; modeling in the Rate of Sale Calculator is extremely flexible in terms of the product, cluster set, and time dimensions that can selected to model demand with confidence</li>
        </ul>
