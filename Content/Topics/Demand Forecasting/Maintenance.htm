        <h1>Maintenance</h1>
        <p>Clean up maintenance related to the archived forecast data may be run periodically to save space on the database server. </p>
        <p>Running usp_Forecast_Maintenance_PerformCleanupGUIDTables will delete all of the “<span class="code_sample">tbl_FCTemp</span>” tables. It is extremely important that this procedure is run just prior to a nightly forecasting job. It cannot be run during or after the forecasting task as it will break many things.</p>
