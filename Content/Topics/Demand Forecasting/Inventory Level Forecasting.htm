        <h1>Inventory Level Forecasting</h1>
        <p>Statistical forecasting, at its core, is a process which will give a result containing some degree of error. The art of mitigating these errors, and in turn producing a highly accurate forecast, is the main focus of the Demand Management tournament forecasting system. Understanding that there will always be some degree of error in any projection will give users a realistic expectation for extracting useful information from the inventory forecasts. </p>
        <p>The Forecasts screen is where you can create, view, and manage forecasts. </p>
