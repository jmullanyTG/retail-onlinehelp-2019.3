        <h1>Forecast Tournament</h1>
        <p>Demand Management’s powerful forecasting engine runs several forecasting methods each time during a forecasting task and, based on the rules outlined in the Forecast Definition module, compare these methods against one another. The methods which are able to provide a series which meets all of the specified rules/requirements will be ranked by method fit (MAPE or mean absolute percentage error) with the highest method fit being displayed.</p>
        <p>It is typical for the forecasting computations to be run as part of an overnight process (commonly a weekly task) for all items, and then managed by exception individually. Forecasts may be re-run for individual items from within the forecast viewer using the same tournament concept, however, certain methods may be excluded or locked for individual forecasts.</p>
