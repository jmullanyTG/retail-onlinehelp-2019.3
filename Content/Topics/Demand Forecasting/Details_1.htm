        <ul>
            <li><b>Seasonality</b> – Seasonality (different from Seasonality Constant) is a value assigned to each item to specify the number of consecutive buckets to consider when determining seasonality trends.&#160; If it is set to 12, a seasonal trend will only qualify if it repeats itself in two sets of consecutive 12-bucket periods.</li>
            <li><b>Creation Date</b> – The date on which the inventory item was added to the database.</li>
            <li><b>Supersession</b> – If any supersessions are lined to the item, details will display here. More information may be found on supersessions within the Supersession module. </li>
