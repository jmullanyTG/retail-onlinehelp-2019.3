        <h1>Practical Application</h1>
        <p>For most users, interaction with the forecasting module will involve the review and approval of forecasts. Users will, upon entry of the forecasts module, be presented with the need to select a filter. </p>

        </p>
        <p>By selecting the check box, users may choose some items from the filter instead of the entire filter. Clicking the “tool” button will launch the “maintain filters” window from the Demand Management filters module. </p>
        <p>The full view of the forecast view will display the graph, grid and details in a pre-defined layout.</p>

        <p>Each of these views may be shown or hidden by toggling the graph, grid, and details buttons in the upper right.</p>
