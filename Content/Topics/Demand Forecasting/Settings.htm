It is set to 0.5 by default (50%) and is considered best practice to keep it there. <ul><li>0 = Only consider simulation</li><li>0.5 = Equal split</li><li>1 = Only consider backtrack</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prevent Negative Forecast</b> – A system Policy Parameter Setting (Disallow Negative Forecast Data) which prevents, or allows Negative Forecast values to be calculated and displayed. It is set by default to “true” and is considered best practice to keep it there.  </li>
            <li><b>Error Method</b> – The method by which the forecast engine grades the tournament winners. It is set by default to “Uniform MAPE” and is considered best practice to keep it there. </li>
