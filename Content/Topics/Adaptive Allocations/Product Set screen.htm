        <h1>Product Sets</h1>
        <p>The Product Set process defines the collection of variants to be allocated. They may be similar to the products used to model the demand or choice count models, or altogether unrelated. </p>
        <p>The <b>Product Set</b> screen contains a listing of product sets and their associated details which will populate once they are created. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Product Set section</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Product Set Name</b> – The unique name for the product set. Will be used to look-up product sets within the scenario plan configuration screen.</li>
            <li><b>Product Set Description</b> – Optional description for the product set. </li>
            <li><b>Variant Selection</b> – A filter of variants which have been selected for potential inclusion in the product set. </li>
            <li><b>Included Attribute Families</b> – The attribute families which should be considered when assessing the product set. </li>
            <li><b>Opt-In</b> – Default behavior for variant selection on creation and update of the product set. </li>
            <li><b>Attribute Weighting Time Frame</b> – Time frame used to define the attribute weighting period. </li>
            <li><b>Attribute Weighting Supplementary Filter</b> – Provides users with an opportunity to specify the sample set of products to use when determining attribute weighting. </li>
            <li><b>Access Level</b> – Used to define user access to the product set. This will control its visibility in this screen as well as restrict its selection for use within a scenario plan. <ul><li><b>Public</b> – Available to all users within the application. </li><li><b>Private</b> – Available only to the creator.</li><li><b>Shared</b> – Available to only specific users. </li></ul></li>
            <li><b>User Select</b> – If set to a shared access level, the list of shared users. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Variant Details section</h2>
        <p>The <b>Variant Details</b> section allows users to determine the sub-set of variants within the filter which should be included in the product set. Upon creation or alteration of a product set, the variant details views will refresh based on the supplied parameters. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">If <b>Opt-In</b> is selected, then on any change to the product set, the list of variants within the variant details view will all be selected (even if they were previously un-selected).</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Selected</b> – Will be checked if the variant is selected to be included in the product set. The default behavior of the “selected” box is determined by the “opt-in” box in the product set configuration grid. If an update is made to the product set while the “opt-in” box is checked, upon save, all variants will become selected. </li>
            <li><b>Variant Code</b> – The unique code describing the variant. </li>
            <li><b>Variant Description</b> – The optional description for the variant. </li>
            <li><b>Total On Hand Units</b> – Total in-network on-hand for the variant. Includes on-order, pending, and supersession stock. </li>
            <li><b>Total On Hand Value</b> – The value, in base currency, of the total on-hand units. </li>
            <li><b>Store On Hand Units</b> – Total on-hand for stores. </li>
            <li><b>Store On Hand Value</b> - The value, in base currency, of the store on-hand units.</li>
            <li><b>DC On Hand</b> – Total on-hand for all DCs. </li>
            <li><b>DC On Hand Values</b> - The value, in base currency, of the DC on-hand units.</li>
            <li><b>On Order Quantity Units</b> – Total quantity on order. </li>
            <li><b>On Order Quantity Value</b> - The value, in base currency, of the on-order units.</li>
            <li><b>Size Fulfilment</b> – A percentage representation of ownership across the size range. While not representative of specific size quantities, it will provide a quick reference for variants with exceptionally broken size runs. </li>

        <p>The <b>Attribute Details</b> section allows users to select which of the initially included attribute families should be considered as when determining allocation quantities. </p>
        <p>Attribute families may be weighted against one another to provide more or less influence on their affinity within the draft process. All attribute families default to 100% as the default weighting factor (even weight). </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Include in Weighting</b> – If selected, the attribute family will be considered as part of the draft process. </li>
            <li><b>Attribute Name</b> – The name of the attribute family. </li>
            <li><b>Attribute Description</b> – The optional description for the attribute family. </li>
            <li><b>Weighting Factor</b> – A factor by which attributes will be weighted against one another. Defaults to 100% (even weighting for all included attributes). </li>
