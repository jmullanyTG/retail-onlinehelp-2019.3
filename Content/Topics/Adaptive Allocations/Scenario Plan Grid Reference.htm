        <h1>Scenario Plan Grid Reference</h1>
        <p>The <b>Scenario Plan</b> grid manages the configuration of scenario plans. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Plan Name</b> – The unique name for the scenario plan. </li>
            <li><b>Plan Description</b> – The optional description for the scenario plan. </li>
            <li><b>Demand Plan</b> – A drop-down of the available demand plans. Must be populated to pass configuration status requirements.</li>
            <li><b>Product Set</b> – A drop-down of the available product sets. Must be populated to pass configuration status requirements. </li>
            <li><b>Choice Count</b> – A drop-down of the available choice count models. Must be populated to pass configuration status requirements.</li>
            <li><b>Plan Length</b> – The expected duration of the stock coverage from the resulting plan. Though not restricted to aligning with the selected demand plan time frame, it is considered best practice not to deviate from the already specified length of time. </li>
            <li><b>Min Pick Ratio</b> – Determines the minimum pick quantity for the draft engine based on a percentage of the ideal pick value (calculated as need target/choice count). This field is hidden by default and will default to system policy specified value (initializes to “50%”). </li>
            <li><b>Max Pick Ratio</b> – Determines the maximum pick quantity for the draft engine based on a percentage of the ideal pick value (calculated as need target/choice count). This field is hidden by default and will default to system policy specified value (initializes to “200%”).</li>
            <li><b>Location Strategy</b> – A key component to calculation of both choice count and allocation volumes, the location strategy will specify the stores which are eligible to receive stock as part of the allocation. The location strategy may be configured within Demand Management Allocations. </li>
            <li><b>Configuration Status</b> – Displays the status of the scenario plan. If configuration components are missing, they will be displayed in a comma separated list within this field. Missing configuration elements will prohibit scenario calculation. </li>
            <li><b>Access Level</b> – Used to define user access to the scenario plan. <ul><li><b>Public</b> – Available to all users within the application. </li><li><b>Private</b> – Available only to the creator.</li><li><b>Shared</b> – Available to only specific users. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Select</b> – If set to a shared access level, the list of shared users. </li>
            <li><b>Plan Status</b> – Defines the workflow options available for the scenario plan. Will updated based on changes made to the plan. Statuses include:<ul><li><b>Requires Configuration</b> – Configuration elements are missing. Refer to the configuration status field for additional information. No workflow options are available until configuration is complete. </li><li><b>Configuration Changed</b> – Configuration elements have changed and a plan calculation is required. Any results currently displayed within the scenario details section are related to the previous configuration and are considered to be “stale”. Workflow options are identical to those of the “ready to calculate” status.</li><li><b>Ready to Calculate</b> – Once configuration is complete, the plan status will update to “ready to calculate” and the draft engine may be run. Workflow options are identical to those of the “configuration changed” status. </li><li><b>Ready to Execute</b> – Once calculation has been completed, the scenario plan results will be available to view within the scenario details section and the plan status will be changed to “ready to execute”. From this workflow status, users may elect to create orders if the results are satisfactory, or alter the configuration to produce different results, which will update the status to “ready to calculate”. </li><li><b>Scenario Finalized</b> – Once orders have been created, the scenario will become finalized and exist in a read-only state to prevent order duplication. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
