        <h1>Scenario Plans</h1>
        <p>Once the dependent configuration requirements have been met, a scenario plan may be created to produce potential allocation quantities. Depending on the scenario outcome, users may choose to convert the potential allocation quantities to orders. The scenario plan screen allows users to build and execute on the combined demand plans, product sets, and choice count models to produce allocation volumes to stores. Configuration occurs within the scenario plan grid and results are available in the scenario details grid. </p>
        <p>Creation of scenario plans is managed within the scenario plan screen. Like all management screens within the Adaptive Allocations module, it may be undocked from Demand Management and realigned or moved to a secondary monitor by clicking and dragging the tab to the desired location. </p>

        <p>New plans may be created by selecting “New”. </p>
        <p>Users will be required to fill in all fields before saving. Access level will default to “public” unless otherwise specified. If any configuration details are deleted, previously executed plan results will not be altered, however, any plans which includes a deleted configuration element will not recalculate (plan status will update to “Configuration Changed”).</p>
