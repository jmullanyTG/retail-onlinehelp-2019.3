        <h1>Allocation Volumes tab</h1>
        <p>The allocation volumes tab displays the potential allocation quantities. Once quantities are verified as a desirable result, users may elect to convert the scenarios to orders. Additionally, all attribute families included in the draft process are returned to the <b>Allocation Volumes</b> view along with the associated attribute value for each item master.&#160; </p>

        <h2>Viewing allocation results in a Pivot Grid</h2>
        <p>You can view allocation results in a Pivot Grid by toggling the view using the <b>Pivot</b> button within the <b>Scenario Details</b> menu section. This lets you view the total volumes by store, by variant, or by attribute value. It is highly recommended to use the Pivot Grid view to verify potential allocation quantities before proceeding. </p>
