        <h1>Demand Plans</h1>
        <p>The <b>Demand Plan</b> section of Adaptive Allocations provides users with the opportunity to determine the source for their calculated variant-store need targets before variants are even selected. As the logical first step in the process, creating and establishing a demand plan will help drive the subsequent decisions throughout the creation of the scenario. </p>
        <p>Demand plans are generated from one of four potential sources: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Financial Plan</b> – A strategic merchandise financial plan. The output of this planning process will be a by period target value for a segment of the product hierarchy. This may be further segmented with a location dimension, but the specificity of a by store plan is usually reserved for location planning. </li>
            <li><b>Location Plan</b> – A by store merchandise financial plan. </li>
            <li><b>Rolling WOC</b> – A calculated rolling weeks of cover value, based on sampled sales history. </li>
            <li><b>User Target Value</b> – A manual entry for a need target. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When creating a demand plan, users will be prompted to select one of these possible demand sources; the configuration screen will then update with the relevant input parameters for the selected demand source. </p>
