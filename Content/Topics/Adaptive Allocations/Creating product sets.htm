        <h1>Creating product sets</h1>
        <p>Creation of product sets is accomplished by using a filter of variants as a starting template. Product set details (variant and attribute details) may be updated by affecting any change to within the product set configuration and selecting “Save”. </p>
        <p>Users may create and configure product sets for consumption during the scenario plan building phase within the product set grid.</p>

        </p>
        <p>New sets may be created by selecting “New”. </p>
        <p>Users will be required to fill in all fields and save before the variant detail configuration sections become available. Access level will default to “public” unless otherwise specified. </p>
        <p>Selection sets (even linked selection sets) may be deleted for users with appropriate permissions by highlighting row and selecting “Delete”.</p>
        <p>If any changes made within the variant details sections, users will be unable to navigate away without a “save” or “undo” action. This is represented by graying out the product set view. </p>
