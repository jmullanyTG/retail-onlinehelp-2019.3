        <h1>Generating Orders from calculated scenario plans</h1>
        <p>Once a scenario plan has been calculated it will be in a plan status state of <b>Ready to Execute</b>. A scenario plan in that plan status state can be converted to an order which finalizes the plan. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Once finalized, scenario plans become read only to prevent duplication of orders. </p>
        <p>The <b>Generate Order</b> button is enabled for calculated scenario plans.</p>

        <p> Once selected, users will be prompted to approve the finalization of the scenario plan. </p>

        <p>Upon approval, the orders are opened within an Order Manager document.</p>
        <h2>Using Order Manager to generate orders from scenario plans</h2>
        <p>Selecting <b>From Scenario</b> within <b>Order Manager</b> displays the <b>Add From Scenario Allocation Order</b> wizard in which an order document based on a particular scenario plan can be generated.</p>
