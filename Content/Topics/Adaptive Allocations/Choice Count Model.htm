        <h1>Choice Counts</h1>
        <p>Choice Counts allow the Adaptive Allocations draft engine to determine the quantity of picks available to each store when meeting their allocation volumes. The choice count is determined by selectively sampling historical sales data. Choice count models are built to sample sales history based on a filter of items, a time frame, sales types, and then removing disqualified sales periods. </p>
        <h2>Choice Count screen</h2>
        <p>Users may create and configure choice count models for consumption during the scenario plan building phase within the choice count model grid.</p>

        </p>
        <p>New plans may be created by selecting <b>New</b>. Fill in all fields before saving. The access level defaults to <b>Public</b> unless otherwise specified. </p>
        <p>Choice count models (even linked choice count models) may be deleted for users with appropriate permissions by highlighting row and selecting <b>Delete</b>.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">The <b>Choice Count</b> screen can be undocked and realigned or moved to a secondary monitor by clicking and dragging the tab to the desired location. </p>
        <h3>Fields</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Choice Count Model Name</b> – The unique name for the choice count model. Will be used to look-up choice count models within the scenario plan configuration screen.</li>
            <li><b>Choice Count Model Description</b> – An optional description for the choice count model. </li>
            <li><b>Product Filter</b> – The filter of items which will be used to calculate the choice count. Though not required, a more consistent result is expected if this filter has some relevance to the product selection used within demand plan generation. </li>
            <li><b>Time Frame</b> – The time frame used to sample sales history. </li>
            <li><b>Sales Volume % of Max Threshold</b> – The percentage of the maximum sales volume of the sample which must be met for a selling period to be included. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Sales Volume of Max Threshold.htm">Sales Volume % of Max Threshold </MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><b>Active Variant Threshold Factor</b> – The percent of each store-variant’s average sales which will set the minimum threshold for de-seasonalized values. This value is available for use when calculating longer sales periods with highly seasonal products within the sample, but is otherwise not applicable to many common Adaptive Allocations scenarios. System default value for this threshold is “0”. This field is hidden by default, but may be returned to the configuration gird through the “choose columns” functionality. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Active Variant Threshold Factor_1.htm">Active Variant Threshold Factor</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><b>Minimum % of Selling Periods Threshold</b> – Defines the percentage of periods within the sample to have recorded a sale in order for the variant to be considered a part of the choice count model. By setting this to a high value, this will eliminate low selling periods for variants which may have set late or had stock-out related issues. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Minimum of Selling Periods Threshold.htm">Minimum % of Selling Periods Threshold</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><b>Sales Types</b> – The sales types included in the sampling. Options include regular, promotion, markdown, and all supersession sales types (should be used for modeled stores and new products).</li>
            <li><b>Access Level</b> – Used to define user access to the choice count model. This will control its visibility in this screen as well as restrict its selection for use within a scenario plan. <ul><li><b>Public</b> – Available to all users within the application. </li><li><b>Private</b> – Available only to the creator.</li><li><b>Shared</b> – Available to only specific users. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Select</b> – If set to a shared access level, the list of shared users. </li>
        </ul>
