        <h1>Status State Permission Blacklist</h1>
        <p>An object (event, promotion, price action, order header) may pass through several states while being worked on within the context of a workflow status. For example, events are marked "in progress" while being worked on within the context of an event workflow status and "completed" when they are ready to progress to the next workflow status. </p>
        <p>Status permission blacklists let you enforce different sets of permissions  based on the state of an object while it is in a specific workflow status. For example, an event workflow may begin with a Planning status. For events in the Planning status, you may choose to grant all users the right to edit events that are "in progress" but restrict edit rights to managers only once an event is marked "completed". As events progress through the workflow, you may choose to grant permissions to smaller sets of users in each progressive workflow status.</p>
        <h2>Denying permissions for specific users</h2>
        <p>You can choose to grant a permission to a Role while denying that same permission to a specific user who is associated to that Role. In this case, the specific user is blacklisted and unable to perform the action even though the Role the user is associated to is not blacklisted.</p>
        <p>Where a Role is blacklisted but not the user, then the user is blacklisted because of their association to the Role.</p>
        <h2>User Blacklist Rights used for the nightly Workflow Heartbeat job </h2>
        <p>The system takes into account the User Blacklist Rights that is used for the nightly Workflow Heartbeat job to determine if a Price Action, Promotion, or Event should be automatically advanced to the next Workflow Status based on the appropriate solution object's current Status State.</p>
        <p>The system will evaluate the user's User Right to 'Modify Status' based on the solution object's current Status’ State:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the Job User does not have User Rights to 'Modify Status' based on the current Status State nor permission to the Transition, the system will not change to the next Workflow Status.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the Job User has User Rights to 'Modify Status' based on the current Status State AND permission to the Transition, the system will change to the next Workflow Status.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Setting permissions</h2>
        <p>Select a workflow status in the Design pane to see its Status Permission Blacklist in the Status Information pane. The blacklist contains a list of user rights and a set of columns representing potential object states.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Workflow Manager/blacklist.png" />
        </p>
        <p>A <b>black</b> user icon in a state column indicates that <u>all</u> roles and users are granted that user right when an object is in that state. A <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6495ed;">blue</span> user icon indicates that at least one role or user has been denied that user right for objects in that state.</p>
        <p> Click on a user icon to view or <a href="Editing a Status Permission Blacklist.htm">edit</a> its user permissions.</p>
        <h2>Object states and workflow types</h2>
        <p>The object states in a blacklist differ according to the workflow type. </p>
