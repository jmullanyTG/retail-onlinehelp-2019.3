        <h1>Demand Management Broker Dispatch Service</h1>
        <p>The Demand Management Broker Dispatch Service (JEBDS) is a windows service that is comprised of a collection of contained services and sub-systems. This allows JEBDS to be able to achieve its two primary requirements of providing generic bi-directional endpoints between the Demand Management Database and Demand Management Developed Endpoints and being able to execute jobs or tasks at a scheduled time, whilst providing granular control on how resources are used for each Action Message execution. </p>
        <p>As can be seen from the <MadCap:xref href="System Overview with no Legacy Components.htm">System Overview (No Legacy Components) Diagram</MadCap:xref>, JEBDS is a standalone windows service that communicates directly with our BLL web services where it augments all of our existing methods and services. To place an analogy on what JEBDS is similar to, one has to look no further than the Supply Chain or Distribution Channels of the Postal Service. While the Push Service is considered the heart of the Demand Management Action Message system with very limited routing capabilities (it requires listeners to be subscribed to the Push Service), JEBDS provides the much needed general routing (it is a listener subscribed to the Push Service) and resource management required for Action Message processing where end users are not necessarily interacted with. Thus JEBDS supplies the required infrastructure for backend process to be able to execute jobs or tasks and communicate or interact with one each other in a very scalable and asynchronous manner.</p>
        <p>As per the <MadCap:xref href="Broker Dispatch Service Diagram.htm">Broker Dispatch Service Diagram</MadCap:xref>, one can observe the various services and sub-systems JEBDS is comprised of and the flow of how these systems interact with each other. JEBDS contains the following services and sub-systems: <a href="Logging Service.htm#_Logging_Service">Logging Service</a>, <a href="Scheduling Service.htm#_Scheduling_Service">Scheduling Service</a>, <a href="Dispatch Accessor.htm#_Dispatch_Accessor">Dispatch Accessor</a>, <a href="Push Service Accessor.htm#_Push_Service_Accessor">Push Service Accessor</a>, <a href="Job Manager Accessor.htm#_Job_Manager_Accessor">Job Manager Accessor</a> and <a href="Action Message Coordinator.htm#_Action_Message_Coordinator">Action Message Coordinator</a>.</p>
