        <h1>Standardized Jobs</h1>
        <p>You can create standardized jobs in the Notification Nightly Purge to delete messages that are older than a certain number of days. In the standardized job, a parameter is available to modify the number of days the messages are stored in the database. By default, notification messages are stored for seven  days. </p>
        <p>The job must be scheduled to run outside of the regular work hours, like on a Saturday from 3a.m to 11p.m. for example. </p>
