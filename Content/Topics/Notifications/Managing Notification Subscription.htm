        <h1>Managing Notification Subscription </h1>
        <p>The Notification Maintenance screen  provides System Administrators the ability to subscribe users to receive solution notifications. </p>
        <p>There are three notification solution areas  on the Notification Maintenance screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solution Subscriptions</li>
            <li>Subscription Properties</li>
            <li>Delivery Descriptions </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may subscribe to all or to a set of core and custom notifications, along with their defaults delivery method, for each Demand Management solution.</p>
        <p>By default, the system  marks any subscribed notification with a Soft delivery method. For details, see <MadCap:xref href="Notification Delivery Methods.htm">Notification Delivery Methods</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>You can change the delivery method on the User Notification Preferences screen.</p>
