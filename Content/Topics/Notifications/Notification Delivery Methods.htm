        <h1>Notification Delivery Methods</h1>
        <p>You may subscribe to all or to a set of core and custom notifications, along with their defaults delivery method, for each Demand Management solution.</p>
        <p>By default, the system  marks any subscribed notification with a Soft delivery method, but you can change the delivery method later on the User Notification Preferences screen.</p>
        <p>There are four types of delivery methods for notifications. If you subscribe to notifications at the Subscription level, the system defaults the selected delivery methods for all users. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hard:</b> the system displays a notification for user manual interaction. When you click  the notification, the system marks the notification as read and does not update the notification flag.</li>
            <li><b>Soft:</b> the system displays a visual notification for five seconds. If you click the notification to dismiss it, the system marks the notification as read and does not update the notification flag. If you do not acknowledge the notification, the system updates the notification flag with the most current count of unread messages. You can click the Notification icon to access the notification later.</li>
            <li><b>Silent:</b> the system does not display any notifications, but updates the notification flag with the current count of unread messages. You can read the notification from your Notification Inbox.</li>
            <li><b>Ignore:</b> the system does not display a notification to the user nor  updates the unread message count. The notification is dismissed and can be found in the notification history.</li>
        </ul>
