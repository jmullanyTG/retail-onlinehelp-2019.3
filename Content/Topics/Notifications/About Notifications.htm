        <h1>About Notifications</h1>
        <p>Notifications inform you when processes (e.g. calculations, forecasts, validations, etc.) have been initiated or completed and if any errors occurred. </p>
        <p>Notification delivery settings are system-configured, but you can change these settings on the Notification Preferences screen.</p>
        <p>There are three notification solution areas in Demand Management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Notification Subscriptions</b>: the Notification Subscription screen provides the ability to subscribe to system-generated notifications, by solution, and configure the default delivery method for each subscription. Additionally, administrators have the ability to create custom notifications, by solution, which can be scheduled and sent by the Demand Management Job Manager or through customized stored procedures (e.g. CUSP hooks) in the respective solution.</li>
            <li><b>User Notification Preferences:</b> allows you to override any system-configured delivery method. </li>
            <li><b>User Notification Inbox:</b> displays the notifications as they were configured. When a notification is received, the Notification icon, on the right side at the top of the screen, indicates the number of unread notifications. Click the Notification icon to display the Notification Inbox.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can subscribe to notifications  and configured them in the following solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allocation</li>
            <li>Assortment Plan <ul><li>Order Manager - Prepack</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Assortment (Receipt) Plan </li>
            <li>Cluster Site Manager (Custom Notifications only)</li>
            <li>Content Manager (Custom Notifications only)</li>
            <li>Curves</li>
