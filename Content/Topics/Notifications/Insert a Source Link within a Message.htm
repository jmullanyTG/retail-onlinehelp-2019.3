        <h1>Insert a Source Link within a Message</h1>
        <p>Source Links are used to direct the user to the desired Solution. To insert a Source Link:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your cursor where the link should appear in the Notification.</li>
            <li>Select the ‘Source Link’ option from the Insert menu. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The system will insert the Source Link formatting (i.e. *[]*) at the required point and the cursor will be placed between the square brackets. Anything between the brackets will be underlined in the message. Please note that it is possible to insert a Token between the brackets as well so that the Source Link has dynamic text. </p>
