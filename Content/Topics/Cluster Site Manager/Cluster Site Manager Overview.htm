        <h1>Cluster Site Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>Cluster Site Manager is used to cluster stores into logical groups for use in Demand Management. </p>
        <p>With Cluster Site Manager, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use partitions and statistical algorithms to cluster stores by both qualitative and quantitative criteria. </li>
            <li>Use templates to quickly create clusters across different levels of your product and site hierarchies.  </li>
            <li>Evolve cluster configurations over time using cluster set snapshots.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Before you Create Site Clusters</h2>
        <p>Before creating clusters, it is vital that business discussions be had to determine what criteria are most important in addressing opportunities in your business. You must also determine the levels of the site hierarchy at which the functions for which the clusters you create will be used to facilitate efficiency throughout. As you plan your clustering strategy, consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How is your business structured in terms of selling channels? Do you need to segment by full and off-priced business, by country, by geography, some combination of all? Are there other factors related to site attributes (capacity, climate, demographic, etc.) that you use to group sites together?</li>
            <li>How is your business structured in terms of roles and responsibilities? Are planners responsible for multiple areas of the product and site hierarchies or are they specialized to certain areas? Based on the complexity of analysis that will be expected of them going forward and the tools available, should this structure be reassessed?</li>
            <li>At what level of the product hierarchy will clusters be different? Do you want to have homogenous clusters that are used across multiple product areas or clusters that are specific to certain areas? In those areas, are there product attributes you want to consider to further specialize your clusters?</li>
            <li>What metrics should be used when clustering stores? Typically, this involves some type of historical or forecasted sales component, but will you use sales revenue, units, cost, margin, margin %, GMROII, some combination of multiple?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to use product and site attributes for the creation of site clusters, <a href="../Attribute Management/Attribute Set Hierarchy Assignments.htm">attribute sets</a>, <a href="../Attribute Management/Attribute Families Widget.htm">families</a>, and values must be defined, and at a minimum, at least one set must be assigned to the topmost level of both the product and site hierarchy on the Attribute Management solution on the Maintenance tab.</p>
        <p>Site and product attribute associations can be set thorough your configured data import processes, but they can also be managed manually in the following places:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Site Attributes:</b> Management &gt; Site Manager &gt; Site Attribute Management</li>
            <li><b>Product Attributes: </b>Management &gt; Variant Manager &gt; Variant Attribute Maintenance</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To Access the Cluster Set Management Screen</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Management tab, click <b>Site Clustering</b>. A Cluster Set blank screen displays.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Manage</b> button. The Cluster Set Management screen displays.</li>
        </ol>
