        <h1>Questions to consider before creating site clusters</h1>
        <p>Before creating clusters, it is vital that business discussions be had to determine what criteria are most important in addressing opportunities within your business. You must also determine the levels of the site hierarchy at which the functions for which the clusters you create will be used to facilitate efficiency throughout. As you plan your clustering strategy, consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How is your business structured in terms of selling channels? Do you need to segment by full and off-priced business, by country, by geography, some combination of all? Are there other factors related to site attributes (capacity, climate, demographic, etc.) that you use to group sites together?</li>
            <li>How is your business structured in terms of roles and responsibilities? Are planners responsible for multiple areas of the product and site hierarchies or are they specialized to certain areas? Based on the complexity of analysis that will be expected of them going forward and the tools available, should this structure be reassessed?</li>
            <li>At what level of the product hierarchy will clusters be different? Do you want to have homogenous clusters that are used across multiple product areas or clusters that are specific to certain areas? In those areas, are there product attributes you want to consider to further specialize your clusters?</li>
            <li>What metrics should be used when clustering stores? Typically, this involves some type of historical or forecasted sales component, but will you use sales revenue, units, cost, margin, margin %, GMROII, some combination of multiple?</li>
        </ul>
