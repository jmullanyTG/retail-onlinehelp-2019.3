        <h1>Currency and VAT Management Overview</h1>
        <p>The Demand Management suite of solutions has been built with the challenges of multi-national businesses in mind. For this reason, we’ve built a number of common views to facilitate user management of currency conversions, value added tax (VAT) rates, and pricing strategies across different areas of your site hierarchy. Regardless of whether your organization is multi-national, must consider VAT in planning, or wishes to use varied pricing strategies across the site hierarchy, users should still familiarize themselves with this functionality, as there are minimum steps required in each to ensure proper calculations within any implementation.</p>
