        <h1>Administrator Panel Overview</h1>
        <p>The Demand Management Administrator Panel serves as a container for configuration and maintenance specific views</p>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>The Administrator Panel should be configured based on the specific needs and capabilities of client IT administrators and/or super-users. It may include some or all of the listed views and will likely vary depending on the scope of modules and service/support agreements in place. </p>
        <h3>To Configure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the various views to a separate view collection, each (some may be combined if desired). Ensure that user access rights are configured. </li>
            <li>Add the view collections to a view collection set (labeled “Administrator Panel”). </li>
            <li>Using the Generic View Collection Set Module, set up the view collection set as a new module. </li>
        </ol>
