        <h1>Policy Tasks</h1>
        <p>Policy tasks are individual tasks that may be assigned both at start and end dates, if required. Policy tasks are sorted by their respective execution orders in the policy task grid. The details of each task display below the task grid.</p>
        <p>It is important to select the correct filters when you build a new policy to determine the application of the task to the intended items. If an appropriate filter does not exists, you can create a filter through the Filters solution. </p>
        <p>The main screen on the Inventory Policy solution displays the current policy tasks and their respective details. </p>

        <p>From the Logistics section of the Policy tab, you can add a lead time day to a policy task to indicate outbound handling lead time value to account for the need of some distribution centers to prepare stock on hand for shipment. In instances where a distribution center may not be able to accommodate an order request the day it was placed, outbound handling lead time may be applied to better represent the realistic ship date from the distribution center.</p>
        <p>The <b>Reset to Default</b> checkbox resets the value in the Outbound Handling Lead Time field to null on the Inventory Policy Task screen.</p>
