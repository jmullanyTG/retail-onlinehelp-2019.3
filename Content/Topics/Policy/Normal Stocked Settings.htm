        <h1>Configuring Normal Stocked Settings</h1>
        <p>The Normal Stocked policy type indicates that the item is  a regular everyday selling item that must be continually stocked and replenished when its ordering criteria are met. Normal stocked items are replenished using a fixed-period ordering methodology. This classification is best suited to items where demand is not intermittent (having periods of no demand interspersed with periods of low demand) and forecasting for future demand is reasonably achievable. </p>
        <p><b>To Configure Normal Stocked Settings</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Execute tab, click <b>Policy</b>. The Policy Task screen displays.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Edit</b>. The Update Policy task screen displays.</li>
            <li>From the Order Policy Type drop-down menu on the Policy section, select <b>Normal Stocked</b>.</li>
            <li>Make the necessary changes according to the table at the end of this topic.</li>
            <li>When finished, click <b>OK</b>.</li>

                        <p>The safety stock for an item is the minimum planned inventory level. Safety stock is insurance stock and is held for two reasons: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To compensate for variances in supplier lead times</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Keeping safety stock ensures that, in spite of lead time and forecast variances, stock will still be available to meet demand in proportion to the service level specified. Safety stock days refer to the period over which the demand can be met with the current stock level. Safety stock typically accounts for 40-80% of the total inventory holding. Because this is  a significant portion, it is recommended to drop the safety stock as low as possible to reduce the overall investment in inventory. To do this appropriately, forecasts and supplier lead times must  be accurate.</p>

                        <p>Safety stock may be set as safety stock days, or service level. A high service level requires a higher volume of units in the safety stock (and higher stockholding costs). Safety stock is held to ensure customer service levels. Demand Management service levels can be specified, and then converted to safety stock values. The higher service levels translate to higher safety stocks; however, when approaching 100%, increased service levels are only achieved through a substantial increase in safety stock investment to account for all lead time and forecasting variances. When evaluated over time, the cost of carrying this additional safety stock can outweigh the profit made by these additional sales. Demand Management has the option to set safety stock based on what is most profitable. This option takes into account the balance of profit margins, forecasted demand and carrying cost into account.</p>
