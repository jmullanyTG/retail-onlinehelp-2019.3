        <h1>Runtime Rule</h1>
        <p>The only difference between runtime and fixed rules is that you have more flexibility in sites to which you allocate. You select the stores at the time of running the allocation.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The size curve will stay the same for all sites.</p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can specify the stores that you want the stock to go to</li>
            <li>You can specify how much each store will get based on an indexed percentage</li>
            <li>You can send out the same size ratio as the stock was bought in</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disadvantages </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It can only send out in one size ratio (the same as what was bought)</li>
            <li>You can only allocate to the stores that are specified in the rule</li>
            <li>You have to choose the exact area you want to distribute. i.e. if you base the rule on a knit class, all products will be allocated based on the knit class sales</li>
        </ul>
