        <h1>Cluster Set View </h1>
        <p>The <b>Cluster Sets</b> view is displayed or hidden in Placeholder mode using the <b>View Selection</b> drop down menu. The <b>Cluster Sets</b> view contains all the essential metrics for building a sales plan and allows users to make Cluster Set or Cluster level changes to the single placeholder or collection selected in the Main Planning view.</p>

        <h2>Data field descriptions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Site Count (Active)</b>: non-editable decimal (10.1) The average total site count and the average active site count (in parenthesis) of the cluster set/cluster between Phase In and Phase Out. Typically, this metric is a static whole number that equates to the sum of the sites in the cluster set or cluster. However, when multiple cluster set snapshots are present during a placeholder or collection’s life, it is possible for site count by cluster to vary over time which necessitates the need for an average count.</li>
            <p>

            <li>
                <p><b>AUC (Average Unit Cost)</b>: user editable currency ($10.01) The average unit cost price for the cluster set/cluster. Displays the weighted average of AUC values for all periods, both actualized and future, beneath.  </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">AUC is not be directly editable once a placeholder has begun to actualize (current date is greater than Phase In date).</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>AUT (Average Unit Ticket)</b>: user editable currency ($10.01). The average unit ticket price for the cluster set/cluster. Displays the weighted average of AUT values for all periods, both actualized and future, beneath. AUT is assumed to be VAT inclusive and is treated as such for all dependent calculations. <p>Because of the potential for multiple currencies, VAT (value added tax) rates, and promotional participation to vary by site within a single cluster, changes to AUT require an Apply to properly calculate the effects on the rest of the plan for a given placeholder/collection. Details for this calculation are available in a supplemental Excel model.</p><p>Period level changes to AUT can be made in the AUT right pane view. See <a href="AUT View.htm">AUT&#160;View</a> for more information.</p><ul><li>AUT is no longer directly editable once a placeholder has begun to actualize (current date is greater than Phase In date). </li><li><p>AUR (average unit retail) being an outcome of the calculation mentioned above is not directly editable.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Gross Margin %</b>: non-editable percentage (10.01%); gross margin percentage for the cluster set/cluster</p>

            <li>
                <p><b>Phase In Date</b>: The phase in date for the cluster set/cluster. If set, selections limit to periods prior to Phase Out.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">defaults to the earliest non-actualized period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Markdown Date</b>: The markdown date for the cluster set/cluster. Selections are limited to periods from Phase In through Phase Out. A markdown date tells the system which period to stop respecting the various constraints utilized in the Receipt Plan supporting view including Min Pres. </p>
                <p>Min Pres drops to zero in the period specified by <b>Markdown Date</b> when viewing the by-period plan for the cluster set/cluster in Sales Plan or Receipt Plan view. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">The markdown date can be pushed by changing Phase In or Phase Out. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Phase Out Date</b>: The phase out date for the cluster set/cluster. If set, the selections limit to periods after Phase In. For placeholders/collections of Replen Status, Phase Out dates are derived from the maximum Phase Out date set in the Forecasting module for all relevant inventories. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Defaults to the last period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Curve Mode</b>: The mode of the selected Seasonality Curve. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Static</b>: The selected curve is applied exactly as it exists at the time of application and the cluster set/cluster’s curve will not change if changes are made to the curve, whether manually in the Curves module or through dynamic recalculation. Think of this as making a copy of the applied curve.</li>
                    <li><b>Dynamic</b>: Changes made to the curve will be pushed down to the cluster set/cluster via automated system processes and the dependent sales plans will recalculate when those changes are pushed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seasonality Curve</b>: The seasonality curve applied to the cluster set/cluster. Used to break down Ttl Sls $ and Ttl Sls U by period in Sales Plan View. Curves must be generated with the Enhanced Filter type to be eligible for use within Assortment Planning and selectable here.

                <p>Because of the potential for multiple currencies, VAT (value added tax) rates, and promotional participation to vary by site within a single cluster, AUR is not directly editable and is only changed as a result of changes to AUT, Phase In, Phase Out, and promotion applications.

                <p><b>Min Pres (Minimum Presentation)</b>: The desired minimum presentation stock per site for the cluster set/cluster. This represents additional non-sales units to be purchased for the cluster set/cluster to maintain adequate stock for presentation within each store.</p>
