        <h1>Variants View (only available in Collection mode)</h1>
        <p>For users who prefer to work in Collection mode, the <b>Variants</b> supporting view is provided to still give access to the individual placeholders that exist within each collection. <b>Variants</b> view automatically updates to show the placeholders within the selected collection.</p>

        <h2>Header area functionality</h2>
        <p>The header area functionality in <b>Variants</b> view is essentially the same as those in the Main Planning view. The exception is the ability to change the data filter parameters since the view is linked to the selected collection in the Main Planning view. </p>
        <h2>Planning area and metrics</h2>
        <p>The planning area in <b>Variants</b> view functions the same as the Main Planning view in Placeholder Mode including: all metrics, the ability to add/remove columns via the column chooser in View Options, and the ability to save and restore layouts. </p>
        <h2>Style bank</h2>
        <p>Users are able to use the style bank to assign variants to placeholders in <b>Variants</b> view in the exact same manner as in Placeholder mode of the Main Planning View. </p>
