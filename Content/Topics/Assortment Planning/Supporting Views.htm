        <h1>Line Visualization Supporting Views</h1>
        <p>The supporting views within Line Visualization are intended to give the user the same access to all elements of the assortment plan while minimizing time spent scrolling and loading custom views. All right, left, and bottom pane supporting views can be quickly expanded, hidden, docked, floated, and configured on a single screen or multiple screens.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Showing supporting views</h2>
        <p>Move the cursor over or click the tab corresponding to the desired view (which can be located at the left, right, or bottom of the screen) while in Placeholder or Collection mode to view it. Click outside the view elsewhere in the screen to auto-hide it.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Show supporting Views.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Views can be sized by hovering the cursor over the edge of the view, changing it to a cross-hair, and then dragging to expand or contract.</p>
        <h2>Docking, Hiding, and Floating</h2>
        <p>Once a view is showing, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Supporting Views_1.png" /> in the upper right hand corner to dock it in the side of the screen it appeared. </p>
        <p>Right click the header area of a view to access the view options menu:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Auto-Hide hides the view and returns it to pre-docked behavior</li>
            <li>Float transforms the view into a floating window which can be sized, docked in other areas of the screen, or moved to another screen</li>
            <li>Dock docks the view in its last docked position (this is only available when the view is floated)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advanced Screen Configuration</h2>
        <p>By clicking the header of any docked or floated view and dragging, you engage the screen configuration helper. A positioning reticle will appear. </p>
        <p>While holding the left mouse button, hover over the arrows to see the target locations of the view. Release the left mouse button while hovering over the desired arrow to dock the view in the location shown.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Supporting Views_2.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 405px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can also drag views to the far left, right, top, or bottom of the screen and layer them over other views. A dock assist outline appears to show the resulting position of the view when you release the left mouse button.</p>
        <p>Lastly, it is possible to right-click, float, and position individual tabs in this manner allowing as many supporting views as desired to be displayed at once.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Screen configurations can be saved using the Workspaces feature (see Header Area Controls &gt; Workspaces above for details).</p>
