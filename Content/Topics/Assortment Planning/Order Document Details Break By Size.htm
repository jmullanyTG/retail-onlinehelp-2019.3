        <h1>Order Document Details – Break By Size </h1>
        <p>The Break By Size tab allows users to split order line quantities across assigned size curves, or specific sizes selected from curves, based on planned sales and anticipated size inventory across clusters. Sizing analysis is done for all order lines on a document simultaneously.</p>
