        <h1>Promotions</h1>
        <p>Promotions planning is provided as supplemental functionality to the main and supporting views in Assortment Planning as a means for users to estimate promotional effects on sales plans so they can buy sufficient stock to support those sales. Plan differences in promotional effects and time frames all the way down to the placeholder/cluster level and easily create product and site level exclusions. Also plan multiple overlapping promotions with various interaction behaviors and best-deal logic built in for advanced planning flexibility.</p>
