        <h1>Receipt Plan View</h1>
        <p><b>Receipt Plan</b> view allows users to identify the ideal receipt strategy for items they are planning to purchase. Functionality includes the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>set constraints, such as minimum Periods of Supply</li>
            <li> define the periods in which receipts are allowed to arrive and how many receipts are needed</li>
            <li>send commitment orders to  Order Manager for final processing, review, approval, and submission to external systems.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Editable Metrics</h3>
        <p>Denoted by light blue row coloration, these are the only metrics that are editable by the user in Receipt Plan view; all others are calculations or reads from other sources. Changing Minimum Presentation in this view WILL update Min Pres in the Main Planning and Cluster Set views, and in Sales Plan View.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Changing Receipt Units in this view WILL NOT update metrics in the Main Planning or Cluster Set views – this is by design, as receipts are suggested in Assortment Planning via a complex algorithm considering sales and all user-specified constraints; because sales are considered in the output already, to then, go update Ttl Buy U would cause the sales plan to change, thus potentially invalidating the results of the receipt calculation. It WILL, however, update Receipt Units in Sales Plan view, as will changing Receipt AUC.</p>
        <h3>Calculations</h3>
        <p>Receipt plans are calculated via the Receipt Planning Engine, which uses a complex algorithm to determine the optimal receipt flow based on sales and minimum presentation by period and user-defined constraints; because of this, system receipt recommendations require user action to recalculate, rather than recalculating dynamically as changes are made in the user interface. Recalculation can be done either for the selected placeholder/collection only by clicking Recalculate Receipts in this view, or for all placeholders/collections that require recalculation by clicking Recalculate in the Main Planning view header area.</p>
        <h3>Receipt Engine Outputs</h3>
        <p>The System Receipt Units and Ideal EOP Units metrics are outputs of the Receipt Planning Engine, which must be re-run when any of the inputs it considered change. These fields will be conditionally formatted any time a change is made that could invalidate the results of the last engine run – changes to sales, min pres, shrink, inventory adjustments, or receipt constraints all fall into this category.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan View_1.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Plan Horizon vs. Receipt Planning Engine Horizon</h3>
        <p>If the Plan Horizon, set at the time of plan creation, extends beyond the receipt planning engine horizon for a given item, data that extends past the receipt engine horizon appears in blue italics with zero values. See example in <b>Plan Horizon vs. Replen Forecast Horizon</b> below.</p>
        <h3>Replen Placeholders/Collections</h3>
        <p>When a placeholder/collection is of the status <b>Replen</b>, the system pulls all relevant data to form its sales plan from the Forecasts module. Users should be aware of the following differences in this view when dealing with Replen items:</p>
        <p><b>Read Only</b>: All normally editable metrics in Receipt Plan view become read only being populated directly from aggregated replenishment forecast data.</p>
        <p><b>Receipt Constraints</b>: All receipt related constraints are managed within the Forecasts module, thus, receipt constraints in Assortment Planning for Replen placeholders/collections are cleared. With a change of status to something other than <b>Replen</b>, the default constraints assigned to any corresponding product level is reinstated.</p>
        <p><b>Receipt Periods</b>: For Replen placeholders/collections, the necessary orders to support forecasted sales are generated from the Forecasts module and sent to Order Manager for processing. Users do not need to set Receipt Periods in this view the way they do for non-Replen items. Receipt Periods are set automatically based on when the generated orders are scheduled to arrive.</p>
        <p><b>Plan Horizon vs. Replen Forecast Horizon</b>: if the Plan Horizon, set at the time of plan creation, extends beyond the replenishment forecast horizon for a given item, the system conditionally formats the periods that go beyond the replenishment forecast as shown below to draw the user’s attention to this. These periods also display zeros for the metrics being read from replenishment data, as no forecast exists:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan View_2.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>System Policies</h2>
        <p>A number of system policies affect the output of the Receipt Planning Engine. These system policies are managed in Maintenance &gt; Policies. However, this should not be done without the assistance of a Demand Management technical consultant. The one possible exception is the following:</p>
        <p><b>Assortment Engine Lead Time</b>: This setting determines the number of days forward from receipt date that received stock is assumed to be available to support sales. The default is 7 to assume receipts are available to sell one week after receipt. This can be adjusted based on a realistic assessment of the capabilities of your supply chain. When the engine is calculating receipts, this setting essentially determines the range of periods it must consider to meet the defined constraints for a given period. See examples for Periods of Supply and Min Stk to Sales below for details.</p>
        <p><b>Allow Receipts After Markdown</b>: (Maintain &gt; Policies &gt; Engine: Commitments) When set to <b>False</b> (default), the Receipt Plan only considers the regular portion of the Sales plan and ignores the markdown phase of the plan. Set the system policy to <b>True</b> if additional stock should be ordered beyond the planned markdown date.</p>
        <h2>Working with Receipt Plans</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Recalculate Receipts</b>: Re-runs the Receipt Planning Engine for the selected placeholder/collection and populates System Receipt Units and Ideal EOP Units with the results. Receipt plan default constraints can be set via Manage Assortment Plans &gt; Defaults (see corresponding section above for details).</p>
                <p>System policies affecting the Assortment Engine output can be set via Maintenance &gt; Policies &gt; Engine: Commitments (see Line Visualization Supporting Views – Receipt Plan below for details).</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> Receipt recalculations require complex calculations and, thus, are sent to the Workload Queue module for scheduling and processing. Though receipts are recalculated immediately, they may be deferred for later calculation based on the number of placeholders requiring recalculation and other jobs currently in the queue. Placeholders awaiting recalculation are locked and conditionally formatted to indicate this.</p>
                <p>Receipts for placeholders/collections in Replen status are calculated in the Forecasts module and read in, thus they will never appear “Dirty” and will not be recalculated when this button is clicked. Instead, the following displays:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan View_3.png" />
                </p>
                <p>All changes to your plan, including changes made to constraints in the Receipt Plan supporting view, must be saved prior to recalculating receipts or they will not be taken into account by the Receipt Engine.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Create Commitments</b>: Sends receipt plan details for all defined Receipt Periods in the current view provided:</li>
            <ol>
                <li> The <b>Commit</b> check box for the period is checked, and </li>
                <li>There is a positive Receipt Units quantity in the period.
				<p>Since orders for placeholders/collections in Replen status are generated in the Forecasts module, it is not necessary to create commitment orders for them in Assortment Planning, thus no commitment orders will be generated for such items when this button is clicked. Instead, the following error displays:</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan View_3.png" /></p><p class="error" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;ERROR: &lt;/b&gt;">if no receipt plans are found that meet the above criteria, the following error displays:</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan View_4.png" /></p><p><b>Yes</b> overrides the constraint and creates the commitment orders in Order Manager. <b>No</b> cancels commitment order creation.</p><p>The system creates one order document per receipt date, containing separate order lines for each placeholder/cluster receipt quantity, launch Order Manager, and displays the documents in separate tabs. Created order documents can be viewed at the left of the Order Manager screen in the Public folder:</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan View_5.png" /></p></li>
            </ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Restore Default Constraints</b>: restores both Placeholder and Placeholder Cluster Constraints to their default settings, as defined in Manage Assortment Plans &gt; Defaults.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">As part of restoring the default constraints involves resetting the receipt periods for the placeholder/collection, receipts are automatically recalculated as part of this process, thus using this function has the side-effect of marking the placeholder/collection in question Clean in the Receipt Status field of the Main Planning view.</p>

                <p>Once a commitment order has been created (see Create Commitments, above), the quantity that was in this field will move into the Committed Units field, indicating that an order has been generated for the planned quantity; as the order moves through the commitment process, the units will transition or On Order Units (or On Order (Unknown) Units) and then ultimately show again as receipt units when the period in question actualizes, provided the units were actually received in that period; this ensures that units for the same order are not double-counted as they move through the process.</p>
                <p>Once the above described transition occurs, it is still possible to add more Receipt Units to this field and place subsequent commitment orders for them as needed; this may happen automatically as your sales plan changes as a result of receipt plan recalculations but you can also simply enter the desired additional quantity in the field then again clicking Create Commitments when ready; each individual order will contribute to the totals shown and be tracked and transitioned through the applicable fields individually</p>
                <p><b>Helpful Hint</b>: Entering Receipt Units at the Grand Total level in this view is a quick way to balance your receipt plan to the Ttl Buy U in the Main Planning and/or Cluster Set views if desired; simply aggregate the pivot grid to the desired level by removing fields as needed (ie. Cluster Set, Cluster, Style, etc.) and enter the Ttl Buy U value in the Grand Total column at the far right – the structure of your receipt plan, including flow dates and % to total of receipt units by period, will be respected while the system balances the period level entries to match the new Grand Total</p>
