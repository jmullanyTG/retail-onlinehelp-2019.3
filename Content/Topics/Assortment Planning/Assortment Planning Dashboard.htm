        <h1>Dashboard</h1>
        <p> The <b>Assortment Planning Dashboard</b> assists an organization in viewing and working with aggregated data to manage the business and drive sales and profits. </p>
        <p> Assortment plans typically contain granular data related to the item plans of an organization, as it represents the detail behind what items are being bought, when items deliver, and the life cycle information for items related to Sales, Cost of Sales, Margin, Receipts, and Inventory ownership. This information can be leveraged within an organization to view plans at various aggregated levels of the product, location and time hierarchies.</p>
        <p> The aggregation of assortment plan data at established levels of the product and location hierarchies over time provides insight to an organization and helps to guide the organization in decisions around merchandising, pricing and promotions, open to buy, profitability and inventory management. Additionally the utilization of attributes can also provide various insights into an assortment to understand the trends and selling patterns.</p>
