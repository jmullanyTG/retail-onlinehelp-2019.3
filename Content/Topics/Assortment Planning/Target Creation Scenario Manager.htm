        <h1>Target Creation</h1>
        <p>Traditional Assortment Planning tools are typically rigid in the way users are allowed to plan: by product and site hierarchy only. This has led to many retailers attempting to gain detail by further extending their hierarchies, but this approach still doesn’t offer true flexibility to adjust strategy as often as desired based on the changing needs of the business.  Assortment Planning offers users the ability to segment hierarchy levels by a wide array of product attributes, both qualitative and quantitative, and then further subdivide and define plan targets and desired new choice counts all the way down to a cluster level.</p>
        <p>Target Creation allows users to create scenarios in as simple or complex as manner as desired. Link scenarios to existing merchandise financial plans, or base your plan targets on specified historical periods. Define business segments by your product hierarchy or based on innumerable variables defined through product filters. Model new areas of business, adjust percent contributions and plan targets at aggregate or more granular levels through Pivot Grid functionality, and calculate recommended new choice counts based on your targets through Rationalization – a marginal return curve calculation that suggests optimal assortment breadth and depth based on cleansed historical data.</p>
        <p>Scenarios can be used to create a foundation for assortment plans through a process called Smart Start. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Smart Start.htm">Smart Start </MadCap:xref>.</p>
