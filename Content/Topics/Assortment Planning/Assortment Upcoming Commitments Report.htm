        <h2>Importance of the Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report in keeping track of created commitment orders</h2>
        <p>The <b>Assortment Upcoming Commitments</b> report is essential to keeping track of created commitment orders and ensuring that the activities required to provide sufficient information to suppliers are completed on-time, thus ensuring on-time delivery of products. </p>
        <p>Efficient use of this report involves setting the <b>Window of Time</b> parameter to include a period from the current week to a number of weeks out based on how long ordering activities such as Break By Size and Prepack analysis normally take. </p>
        <p>If managerial approvals are required in your organization prior to submitting orders, then the <b>Window of Time</b> parameter selected should be increased to include the amount of time anticipated for review and any required changes.</p>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>The <b>Assortment Upcoming Commitments</b> report is controlled by four parameters:</p>
