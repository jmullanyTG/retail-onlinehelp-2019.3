        <h1>Target Data Selection pane field descriptions</h1>
        <p>The <b>Target Data Selection</b> pane can be found on the left of the <b>Target Creation</b> screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Target Data Selection.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Scenario Name</b>: Name for the scenario.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Plan Basis</b>: (Optional) Merchandise financial plan on which to base the scenario.</p>
                <p>If Linked Financial Plan is set for the active assortment plan, populates with branch plans and snapshots of that plan. Otherwise, populates with available merchandise financial plans that are compatible the Product and Site Hierarchy selections for the current plan.</p>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">my assortment plan product hierarchy levels are Company &gt; Category &gt; Class &gt; Subclass and my financial plan product hierarchy levels are Category &gt; Class – this financial plan is compatible with the assortment plan and can be used as a Plan Basis.</p>
                <p>If the selected plan is a hybrid plan from the Merchandise Financial Planning module (plan type = "Hybrid ..."), then only sales types selected in the Sales by Type field below will be used to create the scenario. For all other plans, all sales included in the plan will be used. </p>
                <p>If a Plan Basis is set, the Product and Site Hierarchy selections for the scenario will intersect with available plan data, potentially limiting the scope of the scenario. For example, if I choose a Plan Basis which only contains plans for Mens Apparel, even if I set the scenario Product Hierarchy selection to include Womens Apparel, the system will still only generate segments for Mens Apparel when using the Segment By Hierarchy function.</p>
                <p>When a Plan Basis is set and the Segment By Hierarchy function (see Segment By Hierarchy above) is used to create target segments, Refreshing/Recalculating the scenario will update segments according to specific Site and Product Hierarchy changes made to the plan selected as the Plan Basis.</p>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">I have a merchandise financial plan for Mens Tops for the US and UK and subdivisions of Knits, Wovens, and Sweaters. I create a scenario using this plan as the Plan Basis and Segment By Hierarchy to create my segments; my total Scenario Target is $10M, breaking down as follows:</p>

                <p>In the Plan Basis plan, I increase the total sales of UK Sweaters to $1,000,000 and decrease US Sweaters to $1,000,000 then Refresh the scenario; though the total Scenario Target remains at $10M, the US and UK Sweaters segment clusters each adjust to $1,000,000 each, just as in the Plan Basis plan.</p>
                <p>Creating or altering segments to use a Target Filter instead of being defined by a hierarchy level (as with Segment By Hierarchy) will break the direct linkage to the Plan Basis described above; instead, the scenario will break down the Scenario Target by segment cluster according to % contribution, as calculated from the historical data specified by the Target Filter, Cluster Sets, and Comparison Timeframe.</p>
                <p>It is possible to choose financial plans as a Plan Basis whose hierarchies do not directly correlate with the hierarchies used in the active assortment plan; as long as at least one level of the hierarchies in each plan have matching item master groups, even if those levels don’t fall in the same position in each hierarchy. The system will aggregate/disaggregate the Plan Basis plan data as needed to yield the correct Scenario Target and splits, once segments are created.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Status</b>: Status for the scenario. The status can be: <b>Created</b>, <b>Calculated</b>, <b>Rationalized</b>, or <b>Smart Started</b>. (See Scenario Status Changes below for details.)</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Product Hierarchy</b>: Sets the levels of the assortment plan product hierarchy to be broken down into segments within the scenario.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Site Hierarchy</b>: Sets the levels of the assortment plan site hierarchy to be used within the scenario. This selection also limits which cluster sets are available for assignment to segments within the scenario.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Window of Time</b>: Selects the window of time to be modeled in the scenario. This also sets the window of time to be pulled from the plan selected as Plan Basis, if set.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">This selection must be a single contiguous range of periods. The system will automatically reset the range to the entire window of time between the starting and ending periods if a user attempts to remove periods and save.</p>

            <li><b>End Date Definition</b>: The drop down menu for the new field has two options: <b>Phase Out Date</b> and <b>Markdown Date</b>. The default is <b>Phase Out Date</b>.<ul><li><p>If a user selects Phase Out Date, then the maximum date will be the phase out date.</p></li><li><p>If a user selects Markdown Date, then the maximum date will be the Markdown Date, and Phase Out will be calculated based on the default markdown logic.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Sales Basis</b>: Selects the type for Scenario Target and the basis for Calculation and Rationalization for the scenario (Units or Revenue). This setting also determines the basis for the Target Percent Contribution field in the Segment Cluster Details section.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">When adding new areas of business, whether new products or clusters, this setting determines which metric must be entered first – TY Act New Sales or TY Act New Sales U – to build a sales plan for the new area in the Segment Cluster Details section. </p>
                <p>If Units, enter TY Act New Sales U first, then AUR. If Revenue, enter TY Act New Sales first, then AUR.</p>

                <p><b>Sales By Type</b>: Selects the sales types to be included in calculation for the scenario; types defined during system implementation. If Plan Basis is set but the selected sales types are not separated out in the selected plan, system will default to using all sales for the specified intersection of product, site, and time.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If Plan Basis is set, defaults to the total sales volume within the selected plan for the intersection of Product Hierarchy, Site Hierarchy, and Window of Time defined in Target Data Selection.</li>
                    <li>If Plan Basis is NOT set, defaults to the total sales volume within the intersection of the selected Comparison Time Frames by segment and the Product Hierarchy and Site Hierarchy selections in Target Data Selection.</li>
                    <li>Applying changes to this field will split the value among all segment clusters in Segment Cluster Details based on the Target Percent Contribution defined for each.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Public means all users can view and users with the proper product and site hierarchy permissions can edit this scenario.</li>
                    <li>Private means the scenario can only be viewed and edited by the user who created it.</li>

            <li><b>Sharing Settings</b>: Sets the users with permission to view and edit the scenario. Only valid if <b>Privacy</b> is set to <b>Shared</b>.</li>
