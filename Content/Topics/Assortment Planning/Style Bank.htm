        <h1>Style Bank </h1>
        <p>In implementations of Assortment Planning in which a product lifecycle management (PLM) or similar system is integrated users can use the <b>Style Bank</b> to quickly locate and assign variants to placeholders within the plan. though the <b>Style Bank</b> can only be used to assign variants to single placeholders at a time. </p>
        <p>The <b>Style Bank</b> is available in both Placeholder and Collection modes.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Style Bank.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Style Bank</b> populates all variants assigned to any product hierarchy levels that exist in the Product filter selection in the view parameters.</p>
        <p><b>Product Hierarchy fields</b>: depending on the structure of the assigned product hierarchy, a number of fields will be available to add to the <b>Style Bank</b> to aid in identifying the desired styles. These fields are added by right-clicking any column header &gt; Column Chooser, and dragging the desired fields to the column header area</p>
        <p><b>Product Attribute fields</b>: users can also add product attribute fields to the Style Bank to assist them in qualifying selections of items to assign to placeholders in the Main Planning View; fields are available for all attribute families configured in the Attribute Management tab of the Attribute Management module (Maintain &gt; Attribute Management); these can be added by right-clicking any column header &gt; Column Chooser, and dragging the desired fields to the column header area</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> Attribute family fields are available for inclusion regardless of whether actual values are assigned to the variants displayed, thus it is possible to add attribute family columns that are partially or entirely blank.</p>
        <h2>Filtering the List</h2>
        <p>To filter the <b>Style Bank</b> by any column, simply type in the space provided below the header; use % at the beginning to do a “Contains” type filter instead of a “Starts With” filter; more complex filters can be applied by clicking the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Style Bank_1.png" /> icon that appears when you hover the cursor over a column header and then clicking (Custom)</p>
        <h2>Assigning Variants</h2>
        <p>To assign a variant, simply drag it from the <b>Style Bank</b> and drop it on the desired placeholder line.<p>The system does a live check of the full hierarchy path of the variant you are trying to assign against the path of the placeholder you hover over while dragging it. The cursor will change to a circle with a diagonal line through it if there is a mismatch and you won’t be able to assign the variant to that placeholder.</p><p>Variants that have already been assigned to placeholders in the current plan are conditionally formatted for easy identification (see the above screen shot for an example of this).</p><p>The same variant cannot be assigned to two placeholders within a collection. However, it is possible to assign the same variant to two placeholders in the plan as long as they are assorted to different cluster sets. This is to allow for plan seeding via multiple <b>Target Creation</b> scenarios for different areas of the site hierarchy that will share the same variants.</p><p>You cannot assign a variant over another variant of a placeholder in <b>Committed</b> status.</p><p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">Assigning a variant may overwrite or add to any attributes you have already assigned to the target placeholder; see <b>Attributes View &gt; Dual Directional Attribute Flow</b> for details.</p></p>
