        <h1>Attributes View</h1>
        <p>The <b>Attributes</b> view is displayed or hidden in Placeholder mode using the <b>View Selection</b> drop down menu. The <b>Attributes</b> view allows users to view and manage product attributes for placeholders/collections.</p>
        <p>For more information on <b>Attribute Families</b>, <b>Values</b>, and how their eligibility is set for items within the product hierarchy, see <MadCap:xref href="../Attribute Management/Attribute Management Overview.htm">Attribute Management and Assignment Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Attributes View.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Data Population</h2>
        <p>The view populates with all attribute families that any of the selected placeholders/collections is eligible for. Attribute values available for selection include all values that any of the selected items is eligible for. Attribute family and value eligibility can be set via <b>Maintenance &gt; Attribute Management</b>.</p>
        <h2>Applying Changes Across Multiple Items</h2>
        <p>Whether multiple lines are selected in the Main Planning view, changes are being applied in Collection mode, or both the system automatically resolves any conflicts that exist between the Applied values and the attribute value eligibility of the items the change is being applied to.</p>
        <p>Single-select attribute value changes are applied to all placeholders/collections that are eligible for them. Ineligible placeholders/collections remain unchanged.</p>
        <p>Multi-select attribute value changes are applied additively to placeholders/collections that are eligible for them. If only some of the applied values are eligible, then those will be applied. Ineligible placeholders/collections will remain unchanged.</p>
        <h2>Dual-directional Attribute Flow</h2>
        <p>Depending on where attributes are assigned – to placeholders in Assortment Planning or to variants in Variant Manager – attributes are transferred when a variant is assigned to a placeholder</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">A system policy exists that governs the inheritance of multi-value attribute families when variants are assigned. The system policy is <b>Maintenance &gt; Policies &gt; Module: Assortment &gt; Multi Value Attribute Inheritance</b>. When set to <b>FALSE</b>, multi-value families are applied additively to existing values when variants are assigned.</p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">A placeholder has the multi-value family Embellishments and the values Flocked and Sequinned currently set. If a user assigns a variant with the Embellishments values Flocked and Embroidered to that placeholder, then the resulting values for the Embellishments family are: Flocked, Sequinned, and Embroidered.</p>
        <h2>Assigning a variant</h2>
        <p> Any product attributes attached to the variant are transferred to the placeholder; any attributes that were already assigned to the placeholder but that don’t conflict with the variant attributes (i.e. single-select families that the variant already had assigned), they will remain on the placeholder and also be transferred to the variant.</p>
        <p>When set to <b>TRUE</b>, multi value families will overwrite the existing values when variants are assigned.</p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">Using the same case as the example above, the resulting values for Embellishments would be: Flocked and&#160; Embroidered only.</p>
        <h2>Attribute changes in Assortment Planning</h2>
        <p> System policy <b>Update Variant Attributes In Assortment Planning</b> governs whether changes are allowed to attribute families attached to variants. This policy can be found in <b>Maintenance &gt; Policies &gt; Module: Assortment</b>. When set to <b>FALSE</b>, all attribute families attached to the assigned variant will appear grayed out and will be locked for editing.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Attributes View_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice the Heel Height family in the screenshot is still editable. Creating attribute families that only have the entity type Variant Placeholder assigned allows additional attribute families that cannot be attached to variants and will only be used inside of Assortment Planning for placeholders. </p>
        <p>When set to <b>TRUE</b>, attribute families can be locked/unlocked individually within the Attribute Management solution. Families assigned to the variant entity type and having the AP Updates Variants setting checked are editable in Assortment Planning even when variants are assigned. Changes made to these families in Assortment Planning are transferred to the assigned variant for the product hierarchy assigned to the active assortment plan but are not transferred to other placeholders that variant is assigned to. </p>
        <p>For more information on AP Updates Variants setting, see <MadCap:xref href="../Attribute Management/Attribute Management Overview.htm">Attribute Management and Assignment Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Attribute changes in Variant Manager</h2>
        <p> Changes made to variant attributes in <b>Variant Manager</b> are transferred to all placeholders that variant is currently assigned to across all existing assortment plans that have the selected Variant Hierarchy assigned.</p>
