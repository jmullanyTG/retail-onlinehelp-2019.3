        <h1>Assortment Planning concepts</h1>
        <p>The integration of Assortment Planning with Order Manager and Workflow creates a great deal of flexibility in fleshing out order details and communicating those both within your organization and externally to ERP/POM systems and suppliers. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of the system:</p>
        <p><b>Workflow and Order Document Approvals</b> – a common practice in the retail/wholesale industry is to have approvals at multiple stages in the ordering process, potentially submitting order information to suppliers several times throughout, with increased detail in each submission</p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">I have an order for Men’s Tops with a 6 month lead time from order submission to delivery in the DC. The supplier for all items on the order only requires initial unit commitments up front, with sizing and prepacking details being provided 4 months and 2 months prior to delivery, respectively. Internally, my organization requires review by the planning manager before submission of order details to suppliers. Using the integration of the Workflow module with the functionality inherent to Order Manager Commitment orders, the process can be set to work in document status cycles as follows:</p>

        <p>When defining the workflow that will govern this order, the three main nodes to be created are Initial Commitment, Break By Size, and Prepack. For each node, you have the ability to determine what rights a given user has, thus, you would set it up so that your regular planner users only have rights to do the required analysis step (Break By Size or Prepack in this example) and to Forward the document to their manager for review. In the same node, you would then assign rights to the manager to Authorize if the order is ready to upload and to Reject to send it back to the person who forwarded it if changes are required (see the Demand Management Workflow Manager Standard Documentation for more information)</p>
        <p>As each node is completed, the cycle of analysis, forward, authorize, and upload starts over until all nodes in the workflow have been completed. By setting Completion Days Out for each node (in the example above, this would equate to roughly 180 days for Initial Commitment, 120 days for Break By Size, and 60 days for Prepack) you can track your progress and upcoming submission due dates for the order and ensure you provide the added order details in enough time to meet the requirements of your supplier. These due dates can be reviewed and actioned against in the Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard within Assortment Planning. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report.htm">Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p><b>Expedited Workflow</b>: another common use case in the industry is an opportunity, or at-once, buy, where you must work on a condensed time scale that does not allow for the standard approval process normally used in your organization</p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">I have a rush order for Men’s Tops that I need to receive in 3 months from order submission to delivery in the DC. I have spoken with the product supplier and they have agreed to an accelerated timeline, but asked that I provide all order details, including sizing and prepack information, up front. To accommodate the condensed timeline, an alternate workflow with adjusted document status cycles should be employed:</p>

        <p>Notice that the three main nodes, Initial Commitment, Break By Size, and Prepack, still remain. Because of the condensed timeline, however, a single individual will be responsible for both Analysis and Authorization of order documents and only one Authorization will occur after all order details have been defined.</p>
        <p>It is possible to set rights so that a manager is still required to Authorize the order or extend Authorize rights to regular planners at your discretion. You can also manage access to the accelerated workflow itself by user so, for example, only managers are allowed to use condensed timeline workflows (see the <b>Demand Management Workflow Manager Standard Documentation</b> for more information)</p>
        <p>Because all three nodes within the workflow must be completed prior to Authorization and upload to the supplier, the workflow should be configured to allow transition between each node without requiring Authorization or Upload Verification for the first two. Only in the Prepack Node should rights to Authorize be made available, as Authorization will initiate upload of the order.</p>
        <p><b>Rainbow Packs</b> – prepacks containing more than one variant, whether these be simply different colors of the same item, or different items entirely that are somehow related, can be achieved easily enough through the integration of Variant Manager and the use of an Order Manager field called Grouping Identifier</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In <b>Variant Manager &gt; Prepack</b> tab, create a new prepack configuration containing the variants you want to prepack together and Save</li>
            <li>In <b>Grid</b> view for the order document, enter identical values in the Grouping Identifier field for the order lines containing the variants you want to prepack together and Save</li>
            <li>In the <b>Prepack</b> tab of the Details view, you will see the Grouping Identifier you entered for the desired order lines listed in the Prepack Groups area – select it, make sure the Calculate field for prepack configuration you created in Variant Manager is checked, and Calculate; the system will use the rainbow pack you created as it would any normal prepack</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Order Documents and Receipt Dates</b> – to meet the requirements of the majority of specialty retailers, functionality for the determination of size and prepack breakdowns for orders. Due to the inherent inaccuracies associated with doing these analyses for multiple receipt dates simultaneously, order manager documents can only be created with a single receipt date each. Unlimited order lines, including different variants and store cluster orders, can be included as long as they all share a single receipt date. This constraint also facilitates the tracking of outstanding activities for orders through the Upcoming Commitments Dashboard in Assortment Planning. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report.htm">Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p><b>Order Workflow</b> – Order Manager has been integrated with the Demand Management Workflow module to facilitate identification of and movement through the various stages of the ordering process, as defined by the needs of your organization. Multiple workflows, ranging from very simple expedited flows, where all stages are completed at once with a single submission of the order, to very complex, with several levels of approval at each stage and submissions to external systems after each, can be configured and used within Order Manager. The number of days out from the receipt date that each stage must be completed is configured in the Workflow module and then compared to the current date in the  Upcoming Commitments Dashboard, allowing users to track their progress against established deliverables. For more information,  see the Workflow Manager help.<p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">Workflow status is set at the order line level of order documents. However, all lines in a document must have the same status to advance the document status and submit the order document to external systems; this is mainly relevant in pre-pack stage, as order lines can be selected for prepacking individually or in groups, in addition to all order lines at once</p></p>
        <p><b>Document Status vs Workflow Status</b> – there are two types of status within Order Manager – document status and workflow status. Document status describes the current ownership or state of the order document as a whole. Document statuses include things like Forwarded, Authorized, and Uploaded, and cannot be changed without customization. Workflow status, on the other hand, describes the stage of the active workflow that the order document is currently in. Workflow statuses are configurable through the Workflow module and can include anything your organization deems important. Available workflow statuses are dependent on the workflow currently assigned to an order document</p>
