        <h1>Commitment Orders </h1>
        <p>Commitment orders can be created for one placeholder or collection at a time within the Assortment Planning module by using the <b>Create Commitments</b> button within the <b>Receipt Plan</b> supporting view. </p>
        <p>Additionally, the <b>Order Manager</b> module gives you the ability to create commitment orders from assortment plans for entire sections of the product and site hierarchies and windows of time at once. (To initiate the creation of new commitment orders in Order Manager, click the <b>Commitment</b> button in the top toolbar.)</p>

        <h2>Supplemental Commitments</h2>
        <p>You can make supplemental commitments during a period within which an existing commitment order already exists. These additional commitment orders are supplemental and are neither an update nor a replacement. The ability to create a supplemental commitment is controlled by the <b>Allow supplemental commitments</b> system policy.</p>
