        <p>The Add Placeholders dialog includes:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>New</b>: clicking adds a single placeholder line</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Delete</b>: deletes the selected placeholder line</li>
                <li>
                    <b># of Placeholders</b>: user editable integer; sets the number of new placeholder lines to add when Generate is clicked</li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Mirror Options</b>: user editable check box; when checked, copies the selections made for the topmost placeholder line to any beneath it. It is not necessary to uncheck this option if you want to deviate from the selections made in the topmost placeholder line; simply edit as you would normally and the box will uncheck automatically.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Current Collection</b>: user editable check box; when checked, automatically sets Coll Code and Coll Desc to the values for the collection of the placeholder that was selected when the Add Placeholders dialog was launched</li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Generate</b>: creates the number of new placeholder lines specified in # of Placeholders. If the number of Placeholders is omitted or zero, returns the following error:</p>

            <b>Coll Code</b>: user editable drop down; selects the collection code to which the placeholder line will be assigned</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">select a collection by double-clicking; type in the space below Code or Desc of the drop down to filter the results returned; this acts as a “starts with” filter by default, but can accept “%” as a wildcard to do “contains” type filtering instead</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">new collections can be created dynamically if you don’t wish to assign the placeholder to an existing one; simply enter a description for the collection in the space provided and click New</p>

        <li>
            <b>Coll Desc</b>: non-editable alpha-numeric; the corresponding description for Coll Code for the placeholder line</li>
        <li>
            <b>PH Code</b>: non-editable alpha-numeric; unique system generated code for the placeholder line</li>
        <li>
            <b>PH Desc</b>: user editable alpha-numeric; sets the description for the placeholder line</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Product Hierarchy</b>: user editable single-select tree; sets the product hierarchy level to which the placeholder line will be assigned</p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> this defaults to the lowest common product hierarchy level present in the Product filter in the data selection parameters for Placeholder Mode</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Cluster Set</b>: user editable multi-select; selects the cluster sets to which the placeholder line will be assigned</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">defaults to any cluster sets assigned to the Product Hierarchy level in Assortment Plan Defaults</p>

                    <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">new placeholders are assorted to all clusters within the assigned cluster sets by default</p>

            <p>
                <b>Phase In:</b> user editable period picker; selects the phase in date for the placeholder. Selections are limited to periods prior to Phase Out, if set. Defaults to the earliest non-actualized period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters</p>
            <p>
                <b>Markdown:</b> user editable period picker; selects the markdown date for the placeholder/collection</p>
        </li>
        <p>
            <b>Phase Out</b>: user editable period picker; selects the phase out date for the placeholder</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">defaults to the last period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters</p>
        <p>
            <b>Mkdn No Periods</b>: The time frame for the markdown date to phase out date. Determines what the phase out date should be from the markdown date, once a user enters a markdown date during Placeholder creation (i.e. default is 4, markdown date is 4/29, phase out date will be 5/27, four weeks post markdown.) The default is ignored if the markdown falls outside of the phase in/out window or in the past. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If Phase Out is set first and a markdown default is set, then Markdown date will auto-set to N default periods before the user's chosen Phase Out.
</li>
            <li>If Phase Out is set first but there is no markdown default for the selected hierarchy level, then markdown date is left empty.
If Markdown Date is set first and a markdown default is set, the Phase Out will auto-populate with the N default periods after the user's chosen Markdown Date.
</li>
            <li>If Markdown Date is set first and there is no markdown default, Phase Out will need to be manually entered by the user before saving, or standard phase out logic applies.
</li>
            <li>Any change to either Markdown Date or Phase Out Date after initial value is set does not preserve the default.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Markdown Offset Locked</b>: Links the markdown and phase out dates to each other, so they work dependently on each other, which helps users accurately plan the entire life of the item including markdowns. The standard default mode keeps the markdown and phase out dates independent of each other. Locked mode cannot be enabled on an item with infinite phase out.</p>
            <p>The new mode is set at the Placeholder Instance level.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If Markdown date changes, Phase Out also changes to keep the specified number of periods between them.</li>
                <li>If Phase Out changes, then Markdown date also changes to keep the specified number of periods between them.</li>
                <li>If markdown falls outside of phase in/out window, or in the past, then the default is ignored and the lock-step mode is disabled. Date selectors will take into account the lock step / default range so that the user cannot select themselves into a contradictory state.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p>
            <b>AUT</b>: user editable currency ($10.01); sets the home currency AUT (average unit ticket) for the placeholder line</p>
        <p>
            <b>Like PH</b>: user editable drop down; selects another placeholder item to use as a Like Style from which the system can seed a sales plan; not required. Populates with placeholder items that exist within the selected Product Hierarchy for the line</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">type in the space below Code, Desc, Phase In, or Phase Out of the drop down to filter the results returned; this acts as a “starts with” filter by default, but can accept “%” as a wildcard to do “contains” type filtering instead </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">If set, this will copy the Like PH’s Size Option, Curve Mode, Seasonality Curve, and AUT (unless specified in Ticket Price), can calculate a sales plan based on sales present for the selected Like PH between the Comp Start and End dates specified<br></br><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Placeholder Collection Modes_3.png"></img></p>
        <li>
            <b>Attrib Copy</b>: user editable check box; only valid if Like PH is set; defines whether any product attributes assigned to the Like PH will be copied to the new placeholder line or if any defined attribute defaults for the Product Hierarchy level will be assigned instead (see Attribute Management Standard Documentation for more details)</li>
        <li>
            <b>Mod Factor</b>: user editable decimal (1.01); only valid if Like PH is set; defines a factor multiply the sales history of the Like PH by; defaults to 1.0</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Comp Start</b>: user editable period picker; only valid if Like PH is set; defines the start date for the desired window of time from which to capture sales for the Like PH</p>

                <li>Selections limit to periods prior to Comp End, if set</li>
                <li>Defaults to the Phase In of the Like PH</li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Comp End</b>: user editable period picker; only valid if Like PH is set; defines the end date for the desired window of time from which to capture sales for the Like PH</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selections limit to periods after Comp Start, if set</li>
                <li>Defaults to the Phase Out of the Like PH</li>
