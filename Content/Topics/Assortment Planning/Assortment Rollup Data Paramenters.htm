        <h1>Assortment Rollup Data Parameters</h1>
        <p>The Assortment Rollup is controlled by eight parameters:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Data Parameters.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Product</b>: A product filter to define the items to be included in the aggregate rollup at the selected Product Hierarchy Level<ul><li><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters.png" />&#160; Launches the Filter Conditions dialog allowing users to edit the criteria for the selected filter prior to executing it. The option also exists to create a new filter from the adjusted criteria.</li><li><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters_1.png" />&#160; Launches the Maintain Filter dialog allowing users to create or import a new filter, or update, delete, or export an existing filter.</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Site Hierarchy Level</b>: Selects the level of the site hierarchy at which to view and analyze the metrics contained in the view. </p>
                <p>This selection drives the level of the site hierarchy in which the assortment plan data will be aggregated to.&#160; </p>
                <p>For example, if the user selects cluster set as the site hierarchy level parameter selection, the assortment rollup displays all aggregated data in the view at the cluster set level, but no lower than that level from a site hierarchical perspective.&#160; The data displayed in the view can be aggregated to levels above cluster set dynamically.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Site Hierarchy</b>: The specific levels of the current plan’s Site Hierarchy to include in the current view.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Product Hierarchy Level</b>: The level of the product hierarchy at which to view and analyze the metrics contained in the view.</p>
                <p>This selection drives the level of the product hierarchy in which the assortment plan data will be aggregated to.&#160; </p>
                <p>For example, if the user selects sub-department as the product hierarchy level parameter selection, the assortment rollup displays all aggregated data in this view at the sub-department level, but no lower than that level from a product hierarchical perspective. The data displayed in the view can be aggregated to levels above sub-department dynamically</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cluster Sets</b>: The cluster sets to include in the current view. The cluster sets listed include all default and additionally available cluster sets for the product level selected in the Product parameter.<p>While cluster sets are not explicitly part of the Site Hierarchy they are directly related. Cluster sets in a given assortment plan must be contained within a single lowest level of that hierarchy. Because of this, the Cluster Set drop down populates with the cluster sets contained beneath the selected Site Hierarchy levels.</p></li>
            <li><b>Window of Time</b>: Tthe window of time to display in the current view.<p class="warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;WARNING: &lt;/b&gt;">The selected time frame must be a contiguous range of periods. If it is not, the system still uses the window of time defined by the first and last selected periods.</p></li>
            <li><b>Comparison Snapshot</b>: A snapshot for the current plan from which to populate comparison metrics in the view.&#160; <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> For detailed information on taking snapshots to create comparisons against the assortment plan, see <MadCap:xref href="Snapshot Tab.htm">Snapshot Tab </MadCap:xref>.&#160; </p></li>
            <li><b>View Mode</b>: The view mode for the assortment rollup:  <ul><li>Total Company: allows the user to view/plan revenue and unit metrics as total company values – meaning the total volume for all sites contained in whatever level the Pivot Grid is aggregated to</li><li>Average Store: allows the user to view/plan revenue and unit metrics as average store values – meaning the per site volume for the number of sites contained in whatever level the Pivot Grid is aggregated to</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Display Currency</b>: The currency to display for all revenue based fields in the view. Defaults to the Home Currency for the active Assortment Plan.<p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Due to the amount of data that can potentially be returned in the view via these selection parameters, there are levels at which the performance of the pivot grid will become sub-optimal. If the data that would be returned by a parameter set exceeds the established system threshold, the system displays an error indicating this and allows the user to revise their parameters.</p></li>
        </ul>
