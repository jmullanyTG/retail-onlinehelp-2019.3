            <li><b>Delete</b>: Deletes the selected placeholder line.</li>
            <li><b># of Placeholders</b>: The number of new placeholder lines to add when <b>Generate</b> is clicked.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Mirror Options</b>: When checked, copies the selections made for the topmost placeholder line to any beneath it.

            <li>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Grid columns</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Coll Code</b>: The collection code to which the placeholder line is assigned.</li>
            <li><b>Coll Desc</b>: The corresponding description for Coll Code for the placeholder line.</li>
            <li><b>PH Code</b>: A unique system generated code for the placeholder line.</li>
            <li><b>PH Desc</b>: The description for the placeholder line.</li>
            <li><b>Product Hierarchy</b>: The product hierarchy level to which the placeholder line will be assigned. This defaults to the lowest common product hierarchy level present in the Product filter in the data selection parameters for Placeholder Mode.</li>
            <li><b>Cluster Set</b>: The cluster sets to which the placeholder line will be assigned. Defaults to any cluster sets assigned to the Product Hierarchy level in Assortment Plan Defaults.
			<p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">New placeholders are assorted to all clusters within the assigned cluster sets by default.</p></li>
            <li><b>Phase In:</b> The phase in date for the placeholder. Selections are limited to periods prior to Phase Out, if set. Defaults to the earliest non-actualized period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters.</li>
            <li><b>Markdown:</b> The markdown date for the placeholder/collection.</li>
            <li><b>Phase Out</b>: The phase out date for the placeholder.
			<p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Defaults to the last period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters.</p></li>
            <li><b>Mkdn No Periods</b>: The time frame for the markdown date to phase out date. Determines what the phase out date should be from the markdown date, once a user enters a markdown date during Placeholder creation (i.e. default is 4, markdown date is 4/29, phase out date will be 5/27, four weeks post markdown.) The default is ignored if the markdown falls outside of the phase in/out window or in the past. 
				<ul><li>If Phase Out is set first and a markdown default is set, then Markdown date will auto-set to N default periods before the user's chosen Phase Out.</li><li>If Phase Out is set first but there is no markdown default for the selected hierarchy level, then markdown date is left empty. If Markdown Date is set first and a markdown default is set, the Phase Out will auto-populate with the N default periods after the user's chosen Markdown Date.</li><li>If Markdown Date is set first and there is no markdown default, Phase Out will need to be manually entered by the user before saving, or standard phase out logic applies.</li><li>Any change to either Markdown Date or Phase Out Date after initial value is set does not preserve the default.</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Markdown Offset Locked</b>: Links the markdown and phase out dates to each other, so they work dependently on each other, which helps users accurately plan the entire life of the item including markdowns. The standard default mode keeps the markdown and phase out dates independent of each other. Locked mode cannot be enabled on an item with infinite phase out.
				<p>The new mode is set at the Placeholder Instance level.</p><ul><li>If Markdown date changes, Phase Out also changes to keep the specified number of periods between them.</li><li>If Phase Out changes, then Markdown date also changes to keep the specified number of periods between them.</li><li>If markdown falls outside of phase in/out window, or in the past, then the default is ignored and the lock-step mode is disabled. Date selectors will take into account the lock step / default range so that the user cannot select themselves into a contradictory state.</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>AUT</b>: The home currency average unit ticket (AUT) for the placeholder line.</li>
            <li><b>Map From Variant</b>: (Optional) Another placeholder item to use as a Like Style from which the system can seed a sales plan. Populates with placeholder items that exist within the selected Product Hierarchy for the line. Type in the relevant field to filter the results.
				<p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">If set, this copies the Like PH’s Size Option, Curve Mode, Seasonality Curve, and AUT (unless specified in Ticket Price) can calculate a sales plan based on sales present for the selected Like PH between the Comp Start and End dates specified.<br></br><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Placeholder Collection Modes_3.png"></img></p> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
            <li><b>Attrib Copy</b>: Only valid if <b>Map From Variant</b> is set.
