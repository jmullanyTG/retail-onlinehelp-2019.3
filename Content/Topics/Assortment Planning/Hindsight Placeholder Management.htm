        <h1>Hindsight Placeholder Management</h1>
        <p>The <b>Hindsight Placeholder Management</b> screen can be used to create new placeholders and manage <b>Like Style</b> mappings for new and existing placeholders within your plan. </p>
        <p>To launch this screen, select <b>Placeholder &gt; Hindsight</b> in the Main Planning View (this is not available in Collection view). </p>

        <h2>Drag and drop capability</h2>
        <p>Regardless of the view configuration (with Current on the left and Historical on the right or vice versa) users can drag and drop items from both sections to the other to set Map From Variants/Map To PHs (see below for details on these fields).</p>
        <h2>Toolbar functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b># Placeholders</b>: The number of new placeholder lines to add when <b>New</b> is clicked.</li>
            <li><b>New</b>: Adds the number of new placeholder lines specified in <b># Placeholders</b> to the bottom of the <b>Current</b> grid.</li>
            <li><b>Clear</b>: Removes mapped <b>Like Styles</b> (Map From Variant) for selected placeholders</li>
            <li><b>Delete</b>: Deletes selected placeholders. Only valid for new placeholders. Existing placeholders are deleted in the Main Planning View.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Mirror Options</b>: When highlighted, copies the selections made for the topmost new placeholder line to any beneath it. It is not necessary to un-highlight this option if you want to deviate from the selections made in the topmost placeholder line. Simply edit as you would normally and the button un-highlights automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Current Collection</b>: When highlighted, automatically sets the <b>Coll Code</b> and <b>Coll Desc</b> columns for newly created placeholders to the values for the collection of the placeholder that was selected when the <b>Hindsight Placeholder Management</b> screen was launched.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Historical</b>: Flips the <b>Current</b> and <b>Historical</b> sections in the view.</p>
                <p>The dynamic of assigning historical variants to placeholders is essentially the same regardless of the layout, but be aware that while a single historical variant can be assigned to many current placeholders, when assigning in reverse, only one variant can be mapped to a current placeholder (if a blend of multiple variants is desired to seed rate of sale for a placeholder, the <b>Rate of Sale Calculator</b> can be used. </p>
                <p>Placeholders that are Inactive or in Committed status will not be shown in the Current section of the view.</p>
                <p>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Rate of Sale Calculator.htm">Rate of Sale Calculator View</MadCap:xref>. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Parameters</b>: shows/hides the data selection parameters for the view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parameter options are the same as in the Main Planning View defaulting to the same product, site, and cluster set selections as in the main view. <b>Window of Time</b> defaults to the <b>LY</b> equivalent of the time selected in the main view.</p>
        <p>Data selection parameters only determine the variants/placeholders that will populate in the <b>Historical</b> section of the view. Current placeholders are populated based on those shown in the Main Planning View.</p>
        <h2>Current section</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Coll Code</b>: Only editable drop down for new placeholders. Double-click in the drop down list to select a collection code to which the placeholder is assigned.</p>
                <p>Type in the space below Code or Desc of the drop down to filter the results returned; this acts as a “starts with” filter by default, but can accept “%” as a wildcard to do “contains” type filtering instead.</p>
                <p>To create a new collection,  enter a description for the collection in the space provided and click <b>New</b>.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Coll Desc</b>: The corresponding description for Coll Code for the placeholder</li>
            <li><b>PH Code</b>: Unique system generated code for the placeholder</li>
            <li><b>PH Desc</b>: The description for the placeholder</li>
            <li><b>Image</b>: The primary image associated with the placeholder. If no primary image exists, then <b>No image data</b> displays</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Product Level</b>: The product hierarchy level to which the placeholder is assigned. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">This defaults to the lowest common product hierarchy level present in the Product filter in the data selection parameters for Placeholder Mode.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cluster Sets</b>: The cluster sets to which the placeholder ise assigned. The cluster sets listed include all default and additionally available cluster sets for the product level selected in the <b>Product</b> parameter.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Phase In</b>: The phase in date for the placeholder. If set, selections limit to periods prior to Phase Out. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Defaults to the earliest non-actualized period within the time frame selected.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Markdown</b>: The markdown date for the placeholder.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Phase Out</b>: The phase out date for the placeholder. If set, selections limit to periods after Phase In. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Defaults to the last period within the Window of Time in the data selection parameters.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mkdn Offset Locked</b>: Links the markdown and phase out dates to each other so they work dependently on each other. This helps users accurately plan the entire life of the item including markdowns. The standard default mode keeps the markdown and phase out dates independent of each other. Locked mode cannot be enabled on an item with infinite phase out.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Mkdn No Periods</b>: The time frame for the markdown date to phase out date. Determines what the phase out date should be from the markdown date, once a user enters a markdown date during Placeholder creation (i.e. default is 4, markdown date is 4/29, phase out date will be 5/27, four weeks post markdown.) The default is ignored if the markdown falls outside of the phase in/out window or in the past. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Phase Out is set first and a markdown default is set, then Markdown date will auto-set to N default periods before the user's chosen Phase Out.
</li>
                    <li>If Phase Out is set first but there is no markdown default for the selected hierarchy level, then markdown date is left empty.
If Markdown Date is set first and a markdown default is set, the Phase Out will auto-populate with the N default periods after the user's chosen Markdown Date.
</li>
                    <li>If Markdown Date is set first and there is no markdown default, Phase Out will need to be manually entered by the user before saving, or standard phase out logic applies.
</li>
                    <li>Any change to either Markdown Date or Phase Out Date after initial value is set does not preserve the default.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>AUT</b>: Currency ($10.01) Sets the home currency average unit ticket (AUT) for the placeholder.  AUT is set to that of the selected variant if a Map From Variant is specified. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">AUT is assumed to be VAT inclusive for the purpose of all calculations within Assortment Planning.

                    <li>Changing assortments for this variant would cause overlapping cluster sets to exist over the same time ranges: This is when the placeholder to be altered is assorted to a variant, that variant is also assigned to other placeholders in the plan, and those other placeholders' combined cluster set / cluster / date assignments would be in conflict if the change was made.</li>

        <h2>Historical section</h2>
        <p>This section displays the placeholders and/or variants contained within the Product, Site Hierarchy, Cluster Set, and Window of Time parameters of the <b>Hindsight Placeholder Management</b> screen. This section functions similarly to the <b>Style Bank</b> in that items listed here can be dragged onto placeholders in the <b>Current</b> section.</p>
        <p>The label <b>Historical</b> is a generic term; based on the parameter selections the user makes. Placeholders/variants from any time frame can be displayed here.</p>
        <p>All metrics in this section are essentially the same as their Current section counterparts except that none are editable when the standard view configuration is engaged (meaning the Current section on the left and the Historical section is on the right).</p>
        <h3>When the Historical Section is on the left</h3>
        <p>This is achieved by clicking the <b>Historical</b>. When this is done, Map to Variant is changed to Map to PH, and the Attrib Copy, Mod Factor, Comp Start, Comp End, Adj ROS $, and Adju ROS U fields become part of the Historical section.</p>
        <li>
            <p><b>Map to PH</b>: Selects a placeholder from those in the <b>Current</b> section with compatible product levels to map the item to as a <b>Like Style</b>.</p>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">This field functions very similarly to the <b>Map From Variant</b> field except that each placeholder in the Current section can only be selected as a Map to PH once in the Historical section, as this view is not capable of mapping multiple items to a single placeholder. To blend multiple items together for the purpose of seeding rates of sale, users must use the Rate of Sale Calculator supporting view. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Rate of Sale Calculator.htm">Rate of Sale Calculator View</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Users can also drag and drop placeholders from the <b>Current</b> section to set the Map to PH. If the placeholder being dropped is already selected as the Map To PH for another line in the <b>Historical</b> section, it is removed from that line and set as the Map To PH for the new line.</p>
        </li>
        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cancel</b>: closes the <b>Hindsight Placeholder Management</b> screen without committing any of the changes made.</li>
            <li><b>Save</b>: Adds all new placeholders created and commits all Map From Variant/Map To PH changes made. Also, this initiates recalculation of placeholder sales plans based on changes made.</li>
