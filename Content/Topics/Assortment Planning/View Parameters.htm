        <h1>Placeholder and Collection mode parameters</h1>
        <p>The following parameters are available in the Assortment Planning module Placeholder and Collection modes.</p>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>Selects a product filter for the current view.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters.png" />&#160; this button launches the Filter Conditions dialog, allowing the user to dynamically edit the criteria for the selected filter prior to executing it; the option also exists to create a new filter from the adjusted criteria </li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters_1.png" />&#160; this button launches the Maintain Filter dialog, allowing the user to create or import a new filter, or update, delete, or export an existing filter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When creating or editing product filters, be sure to distinguish between placeholder metadata and cluster&#160;metadata:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Placeholder metadata fields are prefixed with "Placeholder-" and apply to the total placeholder. </p>
                <p>For example, filtering by Placeholder - Total Sales (Rev) compares the filter criteria against the total combined sales revenue of all clusters that the placeholder is assorted to. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Cluster metadata fields are prefixed with "Cluster-" and apply at the individual cluster level. When you filter by these fields, Demand Management compares the filter criteria to each assorted cluster individually. If any cluster meets the filter criteria, the placeholder is included in the filter. For example, filtering by Cluster- Total Sales (Rev) compares the filter criteria against the total sales revenue of each individual cluster  the placeholder is assorted to. If any cluster meets this criteria, the placeholder is included in the filter </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;WARNING: &lt;/b&gt;">Given sufficient permissions, it is possible for a user to change the Product Level assignment or other properties of a placeholder, causing it to no longer meet the criteria specified by the selected product filter and, thus, disappear from the current view after clicking Execute; the placeholders do not disappear – to view them, simply change the filter selection or adjust the filter’s criteria to include them again</p>
        <h2>Site Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Selects the levels of the current Plan’s Site Hierarchy to include in the current view</p>
        <h2>Cluster Sets</h2>Selects the cluster sets to include in the current view. The cluster sets listed include all default and "additionally available" cluster sets for the product level selected in the Product parameter. 
      
        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters_2.png" /></p><p>To assist users within organizations that have a large number of cluster sets in use in a given assortment plan, an additional filterable field, Product, has been included in this drop down; this column displays the product levels to which each cluster set is available to as either a default or additionally available cluster set. </p><p>While cluster sets are not explicitly part of the Site Hierarchy they are directly related. Cluster sets in a given assortment plan must be contained within a single lowest level of that hierarchy resulting in the Cluster Set drop down populating with the cluster sets contained beneath the selected Site Hierarchy levels.</p><p>Regardless of whether any of the placeholders/collections returned by your Product, Site Hierarchy, and Window of Time selections are currently assorted to the cluster sets selected, the cluster sets will still show in the Cluster Details view, thus allowing users to assort to them.</p><p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">For placeholders/collections to be displayed in the Main Planning view, they must be currently assorted to at least one of the cluster sets selected in this drop down; because of this, if you want to expand a placeholder to a cluster set it is not currently assorted to, you must select both a currently assorted cluster set and the one you want to expand to so the placeholder is visible and then show the cluster details to assort it to the new cluster set; once assorted, you can remove the originally assorted cluster set from the view parameters if you wish.</p><p class="warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;WARNING: &lt;/b&gt;">If you attempt to unassort the last assorted cluster from a placeholder, the system will raise the following warning and not allow you to proceed:</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters_3.png" /></p><h2>Window of Time</h2><p>Selects the window of time to display in the current view. </p><p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">any placeholder/collection whose life cycle intersects with any part of the selected Window of Time will be displayed in the view; this is to allow the user to work with placeholders/collections holistically, as displaying subdivisions of their life cycle might alter the decisions made by the user if they have forgotten or are unaware of the full length of time a placeholder/collection will be for sale.</p><h2>Display Currency</h2><p>Sets the currency to display for all revenue based fields in the view; defaults to the Home Currency for the active Assortment Plan.</p><h2>View Selection</h2><p>Selects the supporting views to be enabled within Assortment Planning. Deselecting views that will not be used can help improve system performance by eliminating the need to store them in memory; this can also be used to reduce the number of active system handles, if you receive errors regarding the number of handles currently in use and/or are getting red “X” marks across supporting views when they are launched.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Selection choices.png" /></p><p>For more information on individual supporting views, see <MadCap:xref href="Supporting Views.htm">Supporting Views</MadCap:xref>.</p><p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">This setting is currently global for the plan and not specific to each user, thus deselecting views will affect other users’ ability to see them; only super users or system administrators should be given permissions to modify View Selection to help avoid issues.</p><h2>Cluster Snapshot Date</h2><p>The time period being worked on.</p></body>
