        <h1>Managing Assortment Plans</h1>
        <p>The Manage Assortment Plans screen is the starting point for all user activities within Assortment Planning. Here, you can create new plans, view and update parameters for existing plans, schedule and manage plan snapshots, configure plan default settings, view cluster set validations, control user access and delete plans. Select plan parameters carefully as many become un-editable once you begin using a plan.</p>
