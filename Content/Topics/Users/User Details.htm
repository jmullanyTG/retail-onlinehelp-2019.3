        <h1>User Details</h1>
        <p>Within the user information window, the user details tab will contain most of the general information common to software user accounts, such as login credentials and password information, and assigned filters.</p>
        <p>The concept of assigned filters will give an administrative user the ability to segment sections of the company data to restrict users, or streamline their individual workflows. Users may be assigned filters built on specific inventories, sites, item masters and many other filter types. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Name</b> – The user name as it appears in the main users window. This user name will also be the login credentials for users to gain access to Demand Management.</li>
            <li><b>User Description</b> – A description of the user account. If it is a cloned user, the description will read as “Cloned from _____” until it is changed (the blank is filled by the user account from which it was cloned).</li>

            <li><b>Cube Role Name</b> – If there is a SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) OLAP cube deployed on the database, Demand Management will need to pass a cube role name to the OLAP cube to access information via the OLAP pivot grid widget. This role name will be stored by user.</li>
