        <h1>Essential Business Concepts</h1>
        <p>The main screen in the users tab will display the current active users list. High level information used to differentiate the individual user accounts is displayed here, and detailed information may be accessed either by highlighting a user account and clicking the “edit” button, or double clicking on the user account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Name</b> – The name for the user account. If it is a domain user, the name will be preceded by the domain. E.g. domain\user</li>
            <li><b>User Description</b> – A description of the user account. If it is a cloned user, the description will read as “Cloned from _____” until it is changed (the blank is filled by the user account from which it was cloned).</li>
            <li><b>User Access Group</b> – Will define the access group to which the user belongs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Much of the detailed information related to the user accounts is found in the “User Information” window, which may be accessed by either double clicking on an existing user account, highlighting a user account and clicking “edit” in the navigation pane, creating a new user by clicking “create” in the navigation pane, or highlighting a specific user account and clicking “clone user” in the navigation pane. The “assign roles” and “assign rights” functions will also launch the user information window, but will lead directly to their respective management tabs.</p>
