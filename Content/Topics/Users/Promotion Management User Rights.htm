        <p>Some User Rights may be incorporated into Promotion Workflow Status States, while others are not affected by Promotion Status. User Rights need to be granted at a global level, but can be temporarily taken away by Promotion Workflow Status State using the User Rights Blacklist. For more information, see “Restrict User/Role Permissions” in Workflow State Manager Standard Documentation to understand blacklisting User Rights during specific Promotion Status States.</p>
