        <h1>Engine Task Templates</h1>
        <p>Some engine chains require a default task template to be available before they can be run. The <b>Forecast before Replenish</b> (FR) engine chain requires that a Replenish Task template be created before it can be used. This task is required to prevent multiple engine task forms from being prompted to the user before the task can be processed. Currently, engine templates are only available for the Forecast and Replenish engines as they are the only ones that have a user-configurable task form.</p>
        <p>The only template that can and will be utilized is the one for the <b>Default Replenish FRChain Template</b>. This is provided to allow for a mostly out-of-the-box running implementation of the FRChain if it is enabled. A user with the correct permissions may need to modify some settings in the template such as which Supply Chain to use, the proper Horizon Days, etc.</p>
        <p>The <b>Engine Template</b> module is located under the <b>Management</b> tab.</p>
        <h2>Creating task templates</h2>
        <p>There are two default task templates that can be used by the Engine to run items requested by the user without requiring any input from the user about the configuration. These task templates are configured by editing a <b>Replenish Task</b> form or a <b>Forecast Task</b> form and saving the updated configuration into the template.</p>
