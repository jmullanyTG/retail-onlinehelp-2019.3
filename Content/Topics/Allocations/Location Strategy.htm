        <h1>Location Strategy</h1>
        <p>Location strategies are groups of sites/stores which are used to ensure that the products are allocated to the correct locations. </p>
        <p>Location strategies may be created and applied to allocation strategies to define the location dimension of both the inventory cache and the allocation orders. They may be saved and re-applied to multiple strategies by multiple users. Location strategies may be based on hierarchal relationships or attributes (when available). </p>
        <p> Strategies may also be duplicated to reduce repetitive work by selecting the “Duplicate” box and clicking “Apply”. All changes require users to click “Apply” before taking affect. </p>
        <p>The location strategy grid will list the location strategies. </p>

        <h2>Defining a location strategy</h2>
        <p>To define a location strategy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <b>New</b>.</li>
            <li>Provide a unique name in the <b>Location Strategy Name</b> field.</li>
            <li>Click on the <b>Site Filter</b> field and select a filter in the Items window.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Save</b> to populate the bottom grid.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the bottom grid, select the check box in the <b>Site Eligible</b> column for each site that is to be part of the location strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Only selected sites are considered part of the strategy. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button in the bottom grid.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Location strategy grid fields</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Location Strategy Name</b> – User supplied name for the location strategy. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Location Strategy Description</b> – An optional description for the location strategy. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Site Filter</b> – List of sites/stores which will be included in the location strategy, driven by site filters. These are the sites to which inventory will be distributed; it is not intended that the distribution centers be included in this list. Location strategies are populated based on the filter contents at the time of the strategy creation and do not automatically update based on filter content changes.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Access Level</b> – Access levels determine which users may use and/or edit the location strategy. </li>
            <li>
                <b>User Select</b> – Displays the specific users for a “shared” access level location strategy. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Duplicate</b> – If checked, upon application, the strategy will be duplicated. This allows users to easily build similar groups of stores.</li>
        </ul>
