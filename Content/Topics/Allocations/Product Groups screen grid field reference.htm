        <h1>Product Groups screen grid field reference</h1>
        <p>The product group screen allows users to build and configure product groups. Once a variant is active within a product group, it may not be placed into any other product groups without removing it from the previous product group (an automated process). Additionally, if a variant is built into a product group, the individual allocation strategy for the variant will no longer be visible within the Allocation Strategy view. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Group Name</b> – The user defined name for the product group. </li>
            <li><b>Group Description</b> – Optional description for the product group. </li>
            <li><b>Group Allocation Priority</b> – Will determine how the variants within the group are prioritized for allocations. <ul><li><b>Lowest SOH</b> – Products with the lowest stock on hand will be granted higher priority. </li><li><b>Highest SOH</b> – Products with the highest stock on hand will be granted higher priority. </li><li><b>Sellthrough</b> – Products with the highest sellthrough % will be granted higher priority.</li><li><b>Margin Rate</b> – Products with the highest margin rate will be granted higher priority. </li><li><b>Aged Inventory</b> – Products will be prioritized based on last receipt date. This is meant to grant higher priority to stagnant items. </li><li><b>High ROS</b> – Products with the highest rate of sale will be granted higher priority. </li><li><b>Low ROS</b> – Products with the lowest rate of sale will be granted higher priority. </li><li><b>Location</b> – Products will be prioritized using the primary DC location. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Max SOH per Variant</b> – Allows users to define a maximum quantity per variant. This will allow users to maintain color maximums when variant level is set to style-color. </li>
            <li><b>Product Eligibility</b> – An item master filter selection which will determine the set of products used to build the group. Further refinement of the constituent items is done through the variant eligibility exercise. </li>
            <li><b>Access Level</b> – Access levels determine which users may use and/or edit the group. </li>
            <li><b>User Select</b> – Displays the specific users for a “shared” access level product group. </li>
            <li><b>Strategy Access Level</b> – Access levels determine which users may use the group within the Allocation Strategy screen. May be different from product group creation and modification permissions.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Strategy User Select</b> – Displays the specific users for a “shared” access level product model. </li>
            <li><b>Created</b> – Revision history metric showing the creation date of the group.</li>
            <li><b>Created By</b> – User ID of the group creator. </li>
