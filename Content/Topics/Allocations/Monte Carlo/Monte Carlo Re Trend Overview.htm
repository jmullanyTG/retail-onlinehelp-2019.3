        <h1>Monte Carlo Re-Trend Overview</h1>
        <p>The re-trending of forecasts is an important step to correctly managing the continued allocation of products as they transition from a pre-season plan to in-season. As products begin to sell, their sales patterns will inevitably trend away from the initial plan (sometimes in the positive, sometimes in the negative) and the included re-trend mechanisms within Demand Management allow users to account for the trends in their sales and form an amended go-forward sales plan against which continued allocations may be structured. </p>
        <p>With the initial launch of the Demand Management Allocations solution, a PID mechanism was included to provide a reactive result set based on potentially limited data. With the introduction of the Monte Carlo simulation re-trend mechanism, organizations now have additional tools at their disposal to provide flexibility when dealing with irregular sales patterns. </p>
        <p>Using historical demand for an item, we try to calculate a distribution for the observed demand values using Monte Carlo simulation.&#160; From there we calculate a dynamic confidence level based on the variability of the item’s demand and the number of observations available. </p>
        <p>Using the confidence level and the demand distribution we calculate a total demand value and compare that to the total forecast over the same time frame.</p>
        <p>A re-trend factor is then calculated based on a desired demand satisfaction percentage.</p>
        <p>There are six inputs into the model:</p>
