        <h1>Allocate Cluster Rate of Sale tab</h1>
        <p>For allocation strategies using the rate of sale by grade demand type, the included rate of sale grades must be selected and applied. This feature will allow users to bypass the need to associate a location strategy with an allocation strategy and further enhance the integrated process of assortment plans carrying into allocation strategies.</p>
        <p>In its most simple form, users are able to set the rate of sale they believe is achievable for each one for the grades by setting the rate of sale override in the Allocate Cluster Rate of Sale tab for each allocation strategy.</p>
