        <h1>Syncing Size Curve Substitutions</h1>
        <p>It is possible to link a site to its Override Site’s size curve so that subsequent changes made to the Override Site’s curve will also be reflected in the site it is assigned to. To achieve this link, do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the lower area of the Size Curves screen, check the Sync Override field for any site with an Override Site assigned and click Save</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">checking Sync Override and Saving for a site that does not have an assigned Override Site will do nothing. The Sync Override box will simply be unchecked when the screen refreshes</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Notice that Albuquerque has been updated with the new values for Anaheim while Atlanta maintains the original Anaheim values, but the Override Site reference is maintained in both cases; this is done to give the users an audit trail of where a site’s curve originated from.</p>
