        <h1>Manually overriding size curves</h1>
        <p>It is also possible to simply override a site’s curve via manual entry. To do this, do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the lower area of the Size Curves screen, click in the cell of the site/size whose contribution percentage you want to change, key the desired value, and click Save</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Manual Size Curve Overrides.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that the total size curve of Atlanta has automatically rebalanced to 100% while retaining the 40% value entered for size M, however, the Override Site has been cleared; by making a manual change, you force the curve to deviate from the Override Site’s curve values and substitute a manual curve in its place</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> making a manual change to a site with an assigned Override Site will also clear the Sync Override check box, if it was checked</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">when rebalancing a curve based on manual changes, the system will attempt to retain all entered Contribution values for a given site’s curve, however, it is possible the system will have to change your entered values to balance to 100% - such as if you manually change the values for all sizes so the total curve does not equal 100%</p>
