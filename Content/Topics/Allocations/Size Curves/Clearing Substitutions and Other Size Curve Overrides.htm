        <h1>Clearing Substitutions and Other Size Curve Overrides</h1>
        <p>To clear any overrides made to a site’s size curve, including size curve substitutions, and revert the curve back to its originally calculated values, do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the lower area of the Size Curves screen, check the Clear Override field of any site where the field is highlighted in orange, indicating an override is present, and click Save</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The Contribution values of the site are now reverted back to their originally calculated values; any Override Sites that were assigned to the sites you Cleared Overrides for will also be cleared. Note that any sites that were assigned the site you Cleared Overrides for as an Override Site and also had the Sync Override box checked will revert back to the Override Site’s original values, as shown below</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> changes to the Is Eligible check boxes of a site you Clear Overrides for will also revert to their original state</p>
