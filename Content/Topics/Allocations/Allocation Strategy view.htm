        <h1>Allocation Strategy screen</h1>
        <p>The Allocation Strategy screen is the main workflow screen within the allocations module, requiring inputs (default or user selected) from the other key components of the allocation module (i.e. Product Model, Location Strategy, Size Curve Selection) to define the holistic strategy that is consumed by the allocations engine. The allocations engine will calculate projected demand and generate allocation orders from distribution centers (D.C.s) to stores to support the projected demand.&#160; The output of a user’s allocation strategies may be viewed in the Roll-Up and Compare screen, within the individual in-line roll-up view, and uploaded to the ordering screens (Order Manager). Users will drive out allocation strategies through the utilization of pre-built or user-defined filters (static and/or dynamic) that return items to the allocation strategy screen, as well as manage exceptions which may be present for any products which have been assigned an allocation strategy.</p>
        <p>This view is populated from an inventory level (item-site combination) cache of data referred to as the inventory cache. The inventory cache is created by combining the products defined by the variant and their constituent sizes (or total ownership in instances where a size range has not been associated) and the sites contained within the location strategy. This will produce a collection of inventories which will be built into the inventory cache.</p>
