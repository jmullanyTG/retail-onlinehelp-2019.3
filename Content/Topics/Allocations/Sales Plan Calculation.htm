        <h1>Sales Plan Calculation</h1>
        <p>In order to generate a forward looking sales plan against which allocation orders may be generated, several user inputs are required. The demand type (rate of sale, total sales quantity, etc.) will have the largest influence on the magnitude of the sales plan, but the sales plan basis and any linked manual causals may affect the overall shape of sales over the product lifecycle. </p>
