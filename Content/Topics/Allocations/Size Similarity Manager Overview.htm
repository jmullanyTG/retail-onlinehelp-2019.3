        <h1>Size Similarity Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>It is not uncommon for the same real size to be present in a database under multiple names (for example, size small could be represented as S, SM, SML, etc.). This could be due to issues with the way data imports are set up or even problems with the master data being fed into Demand Management, but whatever the cause, these additional data points can cause unintended dilution when calculating and working with size curves. The Size Similarity Manager was designed to allow users to identify sizes that should be treated together as one, specify a single name under which to unify and display them, and ultimately work with them as a single entity without the need to manually unify the relevant data points.</p>
        <p>The Size Similarity Manager can be accessed through the Views module – <b>System Utilities &gt; Views</b>. Select Size Similarity Manager from the Navigation Menu.</p>

        <h3>Toolbar</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Header Area Controls.png" />: adds a new similarity set</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Header Area Controls_1.png" />:deletes the selected similarity set</p>
        <p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">this is only a soft delete, thus, deleting a set will not reverse any data migrations that have already been completed – it will, however, prevent the set from being used for any future migrations or data imports. Deleting the set will also make any Similar Sizes that were displayed under the Display Size visible throughout Demand Management once more</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Header Area Controls_2.png" />:launches the Fields Customization dialog; used for customizing the fields shown and layout of the current view</p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Header Area Controls_4.png" />:undoes all changes made in the current view since the last Save and does not commit them to the database; this will also restore deleted similarity sets, provided the deletion has not been Saved</p>
