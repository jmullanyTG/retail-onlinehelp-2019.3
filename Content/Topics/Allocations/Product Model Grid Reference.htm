        <h1>Product Model Grid Reference</h1>
        <p>Product models are built using calculation parameters and product based (item master) filters. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Product Model – </b>The user supplied name for the product model. </li>
            <li><b>Product Model Description –</b> Optional description for the product model. </li>
            <li><b>Model Time Frame Selection –</b> The applied time frame for model calculation.  A time frame must be defined for each product model. Click in this field to <a href="../Time Frame/Selecting a Time Frame.htm">select a time frame.</a></li>
            <li><b>Model Metric –</b> Defines the measure used to calculate the model.  <h2>History Related Metrics</h2><p> Uses Sales History by Type Data. The time frame should be in the past.</p><ul><li>Units – Uses Sales Quantity Field</li><li>Revenue – Uses Total Revenue Field</li><li>Margin – Uses Total Revenue minus Total Cost Fields</li></ul><h2>Location Plan Related Metrics</h2><p>Uses Financial Plan or Snapshot Hybrid Detail Plan. The time frame should be in the future.</p><ul><li>Plan Revenue – The fields are dependent on Sales Types and there are many permutations but consists of Sales related fields.</li><li>Plan Units –The fields are dependent on Sales Types and there are many permutations that use Sales Units related fields.</li><li>Plan Receipts – Uses Target Receipt Units Field.</li></ul><h2>Inventory Forecast Related Metrics</h2><p>The time frame should be in the future.</p><ul><li>Forecast Units – Uses Effective Forecast Field</li><li>Forecast Revenue – Uses Sales Value (Effective Forecast times Price Value) Fields</li><li>Forecast Margin – Uses Sales Value minus Cost Value (Effective Forecast times Cost Value) formula</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Include Inner zeros –</b> When selected inner zeros are retained, versus being discarded during the calculations for Sales History.</li>
            <li><b>Include Lost Sales –</b> When selected Lost Sales Quantity is added to Sales History. Selecting this check box potentially prevents a situation where a store is out of stock and negatively affects the product model.</li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Model Type - </b>Model Type may be static or dynamic.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Dynamic – calculates the contribution down to the Store and Level ID for the Hierarchy ID</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Static – calculates the contribution ONLY down to the Store.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Sales Type –</b> Included sales types (listed in sales history by type) for model creation. </li>
            <li><b>Product Selection – </b>Product selection is built off of a product specific (item master) filter. These filters may be built using the Demand Management Filter Manager to incorporate the desired items used to build the model. </li>
            <li><b>Default Product Selection </b>– A supplemental filter to ensure that product models do not have “zero” values for a store. Should be set to a high enough level of the product hierarchy to ensure that values are present, or all itemmasters. </li>
            <li><b>Access Level –</b> Access levels determine which users may use and/or edit the model. </li>
            <li><b>User Select –</b> Displays the specific users for a “shared” access level product model. </li>
            <li><b>Created –</b> Revision history metric showing the creation date of the model.</li>
            <li><b>Created By –</b> User ID of the model creator. </li>
            <li><b>Last Updated –</b> Revision history metric showing the date of the most recent revision. </li>
            <li><b>Updated By –</b> User ID of the most recent editor. </li>
        </ul>
