        <h1>Stock Availability Restrictions tab</h1>
        <p>Stock availability restrictions allow users full control of the stock which is considered to be “available” for allocation. If stock on hand within a specific DC or on order within a specific PO should not be considered as eligible, users may unselect it; all stock in all DCs (as defined by supply chain rules) and all incoming POs (as defined by supply chain rules) are considered to be eligible for allocation by default. </p>
