        <h1>Location Exceptions View</h1>
        <p>Any overrides applied to a specific location or set of locations within the location strategy are considered to be location exceptions. Location exceptions are viewed and managed within the location exceptions view, which may be accessed by selecting the “overrides” button within the location strategy field.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once configured, conditional formatting (bold) will be applied to the location strategy field within the allocation strategy view to indicate the existence of exceptions. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Within the location exception view, users may apply static override values to any of the listed fields on a site-by-site basis, or through auctioning a mass change. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Additional location information (such as site grouping and hierarchal information) may be optionally returned to the grid to assist with grouping. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Once saved, overridden values will be conditionally formatted with an orange highlight, as will the “clear override?” action check box. Selection of this check box and the application of a save action will clear all overrides for the site. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">A blank or null value in a field does not equate to a zero (i.e. an actual 0). Thus, a user override value of “0” in the weeks of cover field is an explicit user override specifying the desire to hold exactly zero weeks of cover in safety stock for the site, not that the strategy level value should be held.</p>
