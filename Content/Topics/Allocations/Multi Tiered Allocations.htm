        <h1>Multi-Tiered Allocations</h1>
        <p>Organizations wishing to utilize regional or other intermediary distribution centers may configure supply chains within Demand Management which will trigger order recommendations from the eligible sources of stock to the appropriate stores or sales channels with multiple tiers configured in the supply chain. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>With multiple tiers configured, stock will be drawn from secondary/regional DCs to fulfil store need and secondary/regional will request fulfilment from the main DC within the same strategy calculation run. </p>
