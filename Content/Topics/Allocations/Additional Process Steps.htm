        <h1>Additional Process Steps</h1>
        <p>Certain ancillary features which affect how Allocations functions may be found in complimentary Demand Management modules, including Cluster Site Manager, Supply Chain Manager, Inventory Policy, Site Manager, Inventory Manager, and others. </p>
        <h2>Order Manager</h2>
        <p>Once allocation strategies have been fully formulated, the orders must be executed within the order management (replenishment and allocations) module as “from strategy” allocation orders. Here, orders may be organized and processed for approval and export out of Demand Management. </p>
        <h2>Inventory Policy</h2>
        <p>Order multiple values are updated and maintained through use of the Demand Management Inventory Policy module (through the inventory policy pivot grid), or at an inventory (item-site) level within Inventory Manager. Order multiple values are applied at the time of order calculation and will be reflected in the “constrained demand” series within the rollup views. </p>
        <h2>Site Manager</h2>
        <p>Store and DC ordering and receiving schedules may be set and maintained within the Site Manager module. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Receiving Schedule</b> – Controls the days on which a store or DC may receive delivered stock. Orders will not be generated for any day on which stock may not be received into the location. Typically applied to stores. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Shipping Schedule</b> – Controls the days on which a store or DC may ship stock out of the location. Orders will not be recommended for shipment on any day on which stock may not be shipped from a source location. Typically applied to DCs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Schedule sets should be configured within the Demand Management Schedules Manager module. Shipping and receiving schedules may also be applied at the inventory (item-location) level within the Inventory Manager; inventory level schedules will override site level schedule values as they are considered an override. </p>
