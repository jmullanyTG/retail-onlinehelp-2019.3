        <h1>Causals screen field reference</h1>
        <p>The General Information section on the Causals screen displays header level information related to the causal, including the name, and type.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name</b> – The user created name for the causal. </li>
            <li><b>Type</b> – The type of causal. Understanding the distinctions between the causal types and their correct applications is a key to properly using the causals manager.<ul><li><b>(normal) Causal</b> – An additive causal, it will add or subtract based on a non-explicit scoring factor (the default value).</li><li><b>Manual Causal</b> – A multiplicative causal, it will adjust up or down based on an explicit factor, such as a 10% increase or a 20% decrease.</li><li><b>Event</b> – Useful if there is an obvious jump in the data series, but the cause of which is unknown. The forecasting engine will match it to the best fit.</li><li><b>Informational Causal</b> – For informational purposes only. This type of causal is rarely used within the Demand Management system.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bucket Type</b> – The type of container period for the series values of the associated causal. This must match the bucket type(s) of the eventual linked items/inventories.</li>
            <li><b>Default Value</b> – Defines the nominal value for the causal set. In almost all cases, this should be set to 0. Applying a non-zero to the default value will elevate (or decrease) the nominal value to the entire history of the linked items.</li>
        </ul>
