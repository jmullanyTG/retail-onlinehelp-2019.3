        <h1>Series Values</h1>
        <p>How the values are listed and used by the engines will depend on the type of causal. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>For normal (additive) causals, the values will typically relate to an increase or decrease in the overall volume of units. Negative values may be entered if applicable.</li>

            </p>
            <li>For manual (multiplicative) causals, an entered value of 10 = 10% increase while an entered value of -20 = 20% decrease. </li>

            </p>
            <li>Event causals are used to flag a period which is associated with an event. As such, the series values are irrelevant beyond being used as a unique identifier; any number or letter may be used. Any events which span multiple periods should have a different unique identifier per period if the desired effect is to completely remove the event’s effect. If the desired effect is the use the event across multiple future periods, any events with the same unique identifier will average the effect for the future periods.</li>

            </p>
            <li>Informational causals will have series values similar to normal causals.</li>
