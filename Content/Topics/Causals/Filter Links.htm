        <h1>Filter Links</h1>
        <p>The most common way to apply causals is the link them to a filter. These filters should be built using the Demand Management Filter Module, then linked in the Causals Module. Inventory, item master, site, and variant filters may be linked to a causal; all links will be resolved down to the constituent inventories. </p>
