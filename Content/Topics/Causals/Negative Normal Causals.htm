        <h1>Negative Normal and Event Causals</h1>
        <p>The behavior of a negative value within normal and event causals is controlled via the system policy <b>Forecast_IgnoreNegativeCausals</b>, which defaults to a value of “false”. If set to “true” the causal application logic will ignore negative causals as it refers to the slope of the causal factor in relation to the sales data series. Thus, negative causal factors are allowed to have negative effects (but not positive effects) when the option is set.</p>
