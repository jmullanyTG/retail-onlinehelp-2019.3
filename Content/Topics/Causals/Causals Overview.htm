        <h1>Causals Overview</h1>
        <p>Causals tell Demand Management when specific periods of increased demand for your items should not be used to forecast normal demand.</p>
        <p>For example, when a promotion is run on an item, demand typically increases. However, if Demand Management's forecasting engine is not aware that a promotion ran during the period of increased demand, it interprets the increase as an increase in "normal" demand and will&#160;forecast&#160;higher future demand for the item accordingly. To prevent this from happening, you can use a <i>causal</i> to tell Demand Management that the increased demand was caused by the promotion. Demand Management then knows not to count that increased demand as "normal" when it generates forecasts for the item.</p>
        <p> There are four types of causals which can be created in the Demand Management system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(normal)&#160;Causal</li>
            <li>Manual Causal</li>
            <li>Event</li>
            <li>Informational Causal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For descriptions of each causal type, see <a href="General Information.htm">General Information</a>.</p>
        <p>Entering the causals module will allow users to create, view and delete the causals in their system. The existing causals may be viewed by selecting them in the drop down menu near the top of the page, or one-by-one using the navigation arrows in the upper right. Causals stored in the system may be navigated through the drop down menu near the top of the screen, or using the navigation arrows.</p>
        <p>Select the Configuration button to display the historical and future periods (buckets) which are visible in the series value viewer.</p>
