        <h1>Item Master Links</h1>
        <p>The item master link will link the causal to an item master and apply it across all sites. </p>

        <p>Selected items from the filter may be removed from the causal link by highlighting them and pressing the “delete” button. For more information on a specific item, it may be highlighted and “view” may be clicked, which will launch an Inventory Manager view. </p>
        <p>If the items are not appearing in the grid, you have selected items with a mismatched bucket type to that of the causal.</p>
