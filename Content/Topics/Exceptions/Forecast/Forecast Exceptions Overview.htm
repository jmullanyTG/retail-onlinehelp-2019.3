        <h1>Forecast Exceptions Overview</h1>
        <p>Demand Management pro-actively tests demand forecasts against an array of criteria to determine if a forecast needs additional human review. When it identifies such a forecast, Demand Management flags the forecast with an exception so that it can be easily found later. You can use filters to find and review these forecasts by exception type. </p>
