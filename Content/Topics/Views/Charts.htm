        <p>Charts as an individual widget (and not as an extension of a pivot grid or data grid) will add a graphical representation to a data series. There are 59 different chart types which may be displayed within Demand Management, however, the common chart types are bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and several others. </p>
