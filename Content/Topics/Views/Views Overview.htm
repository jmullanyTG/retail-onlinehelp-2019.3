        <h1>Views Overview</h1>
        <p>Views provide a way for business teams to view, interact and manipulate critical data that can be key to the decision making process. Views are built and organized in the views module inside the Demand Management user interface. View collections and view collection sets may be organized within this module and are an integral part of the events, assortment planning, and promotions modules as well several others.</p>
        <p>Through proper leverage of the <b>Views</b> module, Demand Management is highly extensible and customizable in the hands of a fully equipped technical resource. The <b>Views</b> module, in conjunction with the creation of SQL views, will provide the required toolkit for building custom reports and maintenance screens to accommodate any necessary custom workflows.</p>
        <h2>View hierarchy</h2>
        <p>It is important to understand the hierarchy associated with views to properly organize and display them. Groups may be created to help organize view collection sets, but contain no hierarchical data.</p>
