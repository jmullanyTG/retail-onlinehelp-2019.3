        <h1>Presentation</h1>
        <p>The presentation section determines the details and additional features of the chart.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chart</b> – Allows users to affect the appearance of the chart, including background colors, fill styles, borders, and other settings. </li>
            <li><b>Diagram</b> – The diagram section will allow users to manipulate the layout, rotation, scrolling, and zoom functions of the chart. </li>
            <li><b>Panes</b> – Panes will frame the chart. This feature may not be available for all chart types.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Axes</b> – The axes settings will determine if and how the chart axes are displayed. This feature may not be available for all chart types.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Series Views</b> – Series views will allow users to manipulate how the individual series in the chart are displayed and treated.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Point Labels</b> – The point labels section will affect how the data points are graphically represented within the chat. If it is intended for the values to be presented as part of the chart, users must determine how they would like to view that information.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Chart Titles</b> – Chart titles allows users to add a title to the chart. This may be unnecessary as the widget name is typically displayed at the header level of the container.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Legend</b> – If the chart requires or would benefit from the use of a legend, this may be added using the legend settings.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Annotations</b> – Any required annotations may be added using the annotations settings.&#160; </li>
        </ul>
