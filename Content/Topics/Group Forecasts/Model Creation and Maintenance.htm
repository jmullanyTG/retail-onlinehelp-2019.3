        <h1>Model Creation and Maintenance</h1>
        <p>When building a model, all items within the model must share the same bucket type. Creating and maintaining models may be done through the “Group Forecast Model” wizard. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name</b> – A name used to identify the model. </li>
            <li><b>Description</b> – An optional description for the model. </li>
            <li><b>Group</b> – The group forecast groups function as a container or folder structure and may be used to organize models. Folders may be nested if desired. A group must be assigned to a new model. </li>
            <li><b>Filter</b> – The filter selected will define the set of items which are participating in the model. The filters which are available will have been created using the Demand Management Filters Module (a preliminary step to building a successful model is to first build an appropriate filter).<ul><li><b>Hierarchal</b> – Filters based on product or site hierarchies would be built out of the item master or site group values. </li><li><b>Attributes</b> – Filters may be built to include or exclude certain attributes. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Security</b> – As group forecast models can be built to ignore item assign filters. Users creating the models should take care to set security rights which are appropriate for the model. <ul><li><b>Public</b> – Shared with all users. </li><li><b>Private</b> – Shared with no other users. </li><li><b>Shared</b> – Shared with specific users. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sales Types</b> – If sales history by type data has been supplied, users may choose to include or exclude typed sales when building the model. </li>
        </ul>
