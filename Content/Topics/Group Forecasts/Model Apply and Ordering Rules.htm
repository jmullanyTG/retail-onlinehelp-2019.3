        <h1>Model Apply and Ordering Rules</h1>
        <p>The model apply and ordering rules are used for conflict resolution in instances of model overlap for an inventory by creating and maintaining a set of deterministic rules which define the inventory to model mapping.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Model Name</b> – The name of the model.</li>
            <li><b>Order</b> – The order of application to the inventory. The rules are applied in numerical order (e.g. rule 1 will be applied and overridden by rule 2, etc.)</li>
            <li><b>Apply Type</b> – Determines when the rule is applied. <ul><li><b>Do Not Apply</b> – Will not apply the group forecast model to any inventories. </li><li><b>Automatic</b> – Will apply group forecast changes automatically to associated inventories. </li><li><b>Manual</b> – Will only apply group forecast changes if the user requests a manual push.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Apply From</b> – The effective start date of the rule. </li>
            <li><b>Apply To</b> – The effective end date of the rule. </li>
            <li><b>Edit Apply Rule</b> – A button which launches the apply rule editor. </li>
        </ul>
