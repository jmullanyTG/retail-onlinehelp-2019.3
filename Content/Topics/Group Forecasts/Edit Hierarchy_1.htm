        <h1>Edit Hierarchy</h1>
        <p>The hierarchy maintenance window allows users an opportunity to edit the forecasting levels and establish the accuracy grading criteria for the accuracy dashboard. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Levels may be selected one at a time, or several at once using the multi-select. Accuracy tolerances should be set for each level.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Level order may be adjusted as well, however, it is important that if users intend to include the “all aggregated together” level, it must be the highest level order. If not, Demand Management will return and error stating an invalid hierarchy. </p>
