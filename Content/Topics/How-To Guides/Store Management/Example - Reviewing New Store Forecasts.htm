        <h1>Example - Reviewing New Store Forecasts</h1>
        <p>After forecasts have been generated for a new store, either manually or automatically as part of an overnight process, you can review the forecasts for items in your new store.  In this example, we'll look at the forecasted demand for an item at a new store in Calgary</p>
        <p><b>To Review the Forecast for a New Store</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Management tab, click <b>Inventory Manager</b>. The ITems window displays.</li>
            <li>From the Filter drop-down menu, select a filter, and click <b>OK</b>. The Choose Fields widow displays.</li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Choose Fields window, select the fields you wish to display, and click <b>OK</b>. The Inventory Manager Document displays.</p>
            </li>
            <li>In the Inventory Manager Document, filter the Site Name column for <b>Calgary</b>.</li>
            <li>Double-click on an item to display its details pane.</li>
            <li>In the Details pane, click the <b>Forecast Viewer</b> tab to see the demand that Demand Management forecasted for the item at the new Calgary store, based on the store supersession created previously.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Inventory Manager/Example - New Store Item Forecast.png" /></li>
            <li>You can repeat these steps for other items at the Calgary site until you are satisfied with the demand forecasting for the new store.</li>
            <li>If further revisions are required, you can modify the store supersession and any related <a href="../../Supersessions/Example - Using Supersessions to Generate Demand Forecasts.htm">item supersessions</a> as necessary. For example, the new site may not have been added to an item supersession, resulting in no sales or forecasts for the item at Calgary.</li>
        </ol>
