        <h1>Hybrid Financial Planning view</h1>
        <p>The <b>Hybrid Financial Planning view</b> is where users will plan Sales, Sales Units, and Average Unit Retails. Regardless of which method of inventory valuation, Cost or Retail, is in use for the active plan. Through creative use of Pivot Grid functionality, users can quickly aggregate, disaggregate, and rearrange fields in the view, allowing for a more intuitive and fluid process. </p>
