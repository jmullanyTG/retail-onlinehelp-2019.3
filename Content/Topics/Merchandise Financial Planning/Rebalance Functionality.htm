        <h1>Homogenizing Plans using the Rebalance Functionality</h1>
        <p>It is a common occurrence within companies to have multiple versions of a plan for the same product/channel levels and window of time for the purpose of exploring different possible outcomes and/or analyzing the business from different perspectives. Sometimes there is a version built from the location level up and another from the top site level down, sometimes there are multiple scenarios built at the same level, or maybe there are even versions built using different hierarchies altogether. </p>
        <p>Eventually, a reconciliation occurs where those within the planning organization decide which version to move forward with. The version to be moved forward with is the Source Plan version. The goal is to take the desired values from the Source Plan version and homogenize other versions to them. </p>
        <p>If you do not select a particular Source Plan metric (Sales, Sales Units, COGS), then the Source plan does not cause a change in the corresponding metric in the Destination Plan.</p>
        <p>Rather than overwrite the values in the Destination Plan, a rebalanced plan is generated with the word <b>Rebalance</b> prepended to the Destination Plan name. If the Destination Plan is titled <span class="Emphasis">Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span> then the rebalanced plan would be <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Branch: Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span>.</p>
        <p class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">A very common scenario in the retail industry is where there are two sets of planners: Tops-down financial planners and store planners. These individuals create their ideal versions of the larger plan from their perspectives then meet to discuss which total volume outcome is most feasible given all the available data. Once complete, one version is rebalanced to the other.</p>
        <p>Before initiating a rebalance, it is necessary to have two plans that share at least one common site level, one common product level, and a common window of time.  It is not necessary for the common levels of the plans being rebalanced to exist in the same positions (the same number of levels deep). The system adjusts data as needed to ensure the proper values are transferred.</p>
        <p>Once a rebalance is initiated, the system performs the rebalance from the Source to the Destination Plan at the lowest levels of commonality in the product and site hierarchies between plans. </p>
        <h2>To rebalance plans</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Rebalance</b> to launch the <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Plan</span> dialog.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Copying COGS between plans</h3>
        <p>COGS cannot be copied over between cost based plans and retail based plans during a rebalance. They are calculated and used differently in the different plan types. COGS is a ratio of BOP and Sales in the Retail method, but not in the Cost method. Inventory metrics are NOT copied during a rebalance.</p>
        <h3>All other dependent metrics</h3>
        <p>All other dependent metrics in the Destination Plan recalculate per the normal calculations defined in <b>Main Planning View &gt; Metric Details</b> for the appropriate plan type, Cost or Retail. </p>
        <h2>Rebalancing example</h2>
        <p>The Sales metric is the only Source Plan metric selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Plan</span> dialog. The Source Plan metrics Sales Units and COGS are not selected and will not impact the Destination Plan. AUR and AUC will recalculate.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">To copy a metric, select the appropriate check box. If you opt not to copy a metric and do not select the requisite check box, then the Source Plan does not cause a change in the corresponding metric in the Destination Plan. AURs and AUCs will change to reflect the new ratios. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Source Plan</h3>
        <p>The Source Plan is a Location Plan called <span class="Emphasis">Branch - Location Plan</span>. <span class="Emphasis">Branch - Location Plan</span> has Sales Units = 574 and COGS = 11,679.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Destination Plan</h3>
        <p>The Destination Plan is a Hybrid Cost Plan called <span class="Emphasis">Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span>. <span class="Emphasis">Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span> has Sales Units = 15,291 and COGS = 300,978.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Hybrid Cost Branch Rebalance.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The user initiates a rebalance with <span class="Emphasis">Branch - Location Plan</span> as the Source and <span class="Emphasis">Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span> as the Destination. Only the Sales check box is selected from the rebalance metrics.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Plans Rebalance.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>After the rebalance is complete, a new plan labeled <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Branch: Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span> is generated. </p>
        <h3>Rebalance metrics </h3>
        <p>The rebalance metrics are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales has been recalculated as a result of the Sales metric being selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Plan</span> dialog</li>
            <li>Destination Plan <span class="Emphasis">Branch of Hybrid Cost Plan</span>’s metrics Sales Units and COGS are unchanged as these metrics were not selected</li>
            <li>AUR and AUC have been recalculated. </li>
        </ul>
