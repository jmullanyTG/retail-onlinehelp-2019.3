            </a>Creating Snapshots</h1>
        <p>Snapshots serve as the third main concept of plans and can be managed in the Financial Plan Maintenance view.&#160; Snapshots are locked down versions of master or branch plans.&#160; The main differences between a snapshot and any other plan is they do not actualize as we move forward in time.&#160; Snapshots can be accessed on the right hand side of view and will be specific to the master or branch plan highlighted on the left hand side of the view.&#160; To access the snapshot functionality the user will click on the snapshots tab on the left hand side of the view.</p>

            <b>Snapshots Tab</b>:&#160; Launches the Manage Snapshots dialog - this is used to set up plan snapshots which occur on a regular schedule as well as to create and delete snapshots manually.&#160; Snapshots are, as their name implies, captures of the state the current plan at the time they are generated for the purpose of future comparisons as users work with the plan. Snapshots can be used within the main planning view, the comp/non-comp tab and the sales by type tab within Merchandise Financial planning; for details on the metrics included in snapshots, see Comparison metrics listed in under the respective sections for these supporting views.&#160; There are two main components that make up the Snapshots tab.&#160; The top portion of the view is the MFP Snapshot Templates.</p>
