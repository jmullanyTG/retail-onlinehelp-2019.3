        <h1><a name="Branch"></a>Creating Branch Plans</h1>
        <p>When working in the financial plan maintenance view, after the Master Plan has been initialized, users will have the opportunity to create Branch plans.&#160; Branch plans are a copy of the master plan and can be edited by users who have permission access.&#160; To create a Branch plan, the user will follow the same steps as creating a master plan.&#160; A branch plan is a Financial Plan that is created from a Master plan in the MFP module and is directly editable.&#160; The branch plan is used to make changes to a financial plan.&#160; Branch plan examples include “working” plans, “stretch” plans or “shrink” plans.&#160; There is no limit to the number of branches that can be created.&#160; A branch will always be associated with a Master plan.&#160; Once a branch plan has been created it will show up underneath the Master plan it is associated with in the financial plan maintenance view.&#160; </p>

        <p>As mentioned above, to create a branch plan a user will have to go through the same steps as creating a master plan, however all of the criteria in each of the tabs will be pre-populated with the same selection criteria of the master plan.&#160; To create a branch plan, the user will highlight the master plan they want to create a branch from and then click on the Branch icon.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The user has the ability to give the branch a name, description and start period and end period in the first tab that appears.&#160; The two most important tabs when creating a branch are the product and channel tab.&#160; Those tabs will contain the same selections as the master plan, however, the user has the ability to narrow down the selections.&#160; Once the branch has been defined the user will click ok and then initialize the branch in the Financial Plan Maintenance view.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the branch has been initialized, users can open up the branch and begin making changes to the plan.&#160; To open a branch or master plan, the user will highlight the desired plan and click OK.</p>
