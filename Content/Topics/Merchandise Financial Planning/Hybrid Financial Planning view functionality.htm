        <h1>Hybrid Financial Planning view functionality</h1>
        <p>The <b>Hybrid Financial Planning view</b> works in exactly the same way as the main planning view in terms of core functionality.&#160; The purpose of this tab is to allow for the budgeting of growth and/or decline up and down the product and location hierarchies over time to be able to determine the sales activity in these segments of the business.&#160; </p>
        <p>The parameters selected in the main planning view are connected to the <b>Hybrid Financial Planning view</b>.&#160; If a user makes any changes to the parameters defined in the header area, this updates for the main planning view as well as the <b>Hybrid Financial Planning view</b>.&#160; Additionally, the calculation toggles and the locks that are invoked will be consistent with the selections made in the main planning view.</p>
