        <h1>Creating and Managing Financial Plans</h1>
        <p>Financial planning involves multiple types of plans:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Master plan</b> - A master plan is the "single version of truth" and can only be edited through an approval and/or merge process.</li>
            <li><b>Branch plan</b> - A branch plan is a copy of either a master plan or another branch plan. It is a "working copy" where changes to a plan can be made. These changes can then be uploaded to the master plan through an approval and/or merge process.</li>
            <li><b>Snapshot</b> - Snapshots are locked-down versions of a plan that can not be edited and do not actualize. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can create and manage these plans from the Financial Plan Maintenance window.      </p>
