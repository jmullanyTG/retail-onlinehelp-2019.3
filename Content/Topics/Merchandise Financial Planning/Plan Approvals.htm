        <h1>Plan Approvals</h1>
        <p>You can set up a process to review, approve, reject, and merge branch plans. This process can support pre-season as well as in-season reviews.</p>
        <p>The functionality available for the plan approval process is contained with the financial plan maintenance view.&#160; There are header area controls in the Financial Plan Maintenance view that are utilized to drive the process.&#160; </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once a user has made their desired adjustments in the branch plan they are working in, they have the ability to send the plan to an authorized user for approval.&#160; If changes have been made to the branch plan, the plan status will be In-Progress.&#160; To send a plan to an authorized user for approval, the branch plan needs to be highlighted.&#160; </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the branch plan has been highlighted, the user will click on the submit button on the header of the Financial Plan Maintenance view.&#160; The Approve Financial Plan window will appear on the user’s screen.&#160; The name of the branch to be approved will be displayed to the user.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_1_3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The user must select the destination plan for which the source plan is to be approved and merged to.&#160; In addition, the user has the ability to make any notes to the authorized approver to help them through the approval process.&#160; Finally, the user will select the authorized approver to send the plan to for review.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_1_4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the necessary criteria has been selected, the user will click OK.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_1_5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The system will send the plan information to the authorized approver for approval.&#160; The branch plan that has been submitted for approval will then move to a status of Awaiting Approval.&#160; If the plan is approved, the system will automatically merge the approved plan into the destination plan.&#160; The destination plan will change to a status of Approved and the merge history on the right hand side of the Financial Plan Maintenance view will update.&#160; The Merge history tab is an audit trail of approval process and displays to the user when merges were made to and from the plans that are being worked with.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_1_6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The branch plan or source plan will remain in Approved status until changes are made, at which time, the status will revert back to In-Progress.&#160; If the plan is rejected and not approved, the information is sent back to the user with any notes documented by the authorized approver.&#160; To reject a plan, click on the Reject icon and the Reject Financial Plan window will be displayed on the user’s screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_1_7.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The authorized user will then make any notes and send back to the planner to make the requested changes to the plan.&#160; The plan will then take on the status of In-Progress.</p>
        <h2>Best Practice Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When configuring Merchandise Financial Planning it’s important to set up the <a href="../Users/Financial Planning.htm">user rights</a> properly to support the plan approval process.&#160; Ensure only authorized users have the rights to approve/reject and merge plans.&#160; This helps to maintain master plan integrity.</li>
            <li>Before approving plans, it is a good idea to create an additional branch of the plan that will take on the merged changes.  Once a plan has been merged to another, it’s difficult to revert back to the plans that existed prior to the merge or approval process.  This will make it easier to revert back to the plans that existed prior to any approval or merge.</li>
            <li>Create a plan review calendar to establish deadlines for Pre-season and In-season plan reviews.  Users will be able to take full advantage of the plan approval functionality if they know their due dates.</li>
            <li>Limit the number of branches that need approved during the plan approval process.  Creating branches that contain multiple product and location dimensions cuts down on the number of plans to be reviewed and approved.  This will help to streamline the process, especially for In-season plan reviews.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of the notes section during the approval or rejection process.  This will allow the user to focus on the area of the plan that needs reviewed or adjusted.</li>
            <li>Remind users that the notification inbox contains all the changes made in the Plan approval process.  This is where they will see the progress being made during plan reviews.</li>
        </ul>
