        <h1>High Level Target Changes</h1>
        <p>High Level Target Changes are a very common scenario for planners where all the details of the plan are the way the planner wants them and then the entire plan must be taken up or down by a certain percentage, but there are still specific lower level targets to be adhered to.</p>

        <p>Let’s say we’ve built our 2017_m08 Sales plan to $50K across 3 brands, and have just been asked to take the total plan up 10%. Great Value currently accounts for 50% of the business, but you’ve been instructed to hold volume for this brand at $25K. Mainstay and Private Selection have been identified as growth brands so we can allow their monthly totals to rise. The only other constraint is that the totals for wk 32 and 34 for Private Selection need to remain intact. This can easily be accomplished by using locks to hold the specified month and week values then using the <b>right click &gt; Multiple Changes</b> function to increase the 2017_m08 Sales Grand Total</p>

        </p>
        <p>By choosing the second option in the Multiple Data Change Form and setting it to increase the value by 10%, we will raise the monthly grand total to $55K (this functionality is shown for the purpose of example in to use in cases where the % increase is not so simply calculated)</p>

        </p>
        <p>Note the entire plan for the month has recalculated to the new target of $55K, while keeping the locked month and week totals intact and increasing the unlocked periods relative to their previous percent contribution. In this manner, the we are able to maintain the mandatory specifics and overall spirit in which the plan was created very quickly and easily</p>
