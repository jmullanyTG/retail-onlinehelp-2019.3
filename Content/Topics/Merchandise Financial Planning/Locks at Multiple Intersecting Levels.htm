        <h1>Locks at Multiple Intersecting Levels</h1>
        <p>The Demand Management Lock &amp; Spread functionality also allows for locks to be engaged at multiple intersecting levels, such as a lock at the month level as well as locks on multiple weeks beneath that month, or a lock on the grand total of multiple product categories for a period, as well as locks on one or more of the categories beneath</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">situations may arise where users are required to adhere to specific monthly totals while also needing to hit targets for specific weeks beneath. In these cases, users will need flexibility to make changes made to unlocked weeks without breaking the monthly total or changing the locked weeks</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Sales have been locked at both the aggregate level for 2017_m08 and also for 2017_wk31 and wk33. Sales Units and AUR have also locked for each locked period</p>

        </p>
        <p>When 2017_wk34 Sales is changed to $10,000, the only remaining unlocked period the system has to work with is 2017_wk32. The system subtracts both the locked period values of $4,977, and $7,025 and the entered value of $10,000 from the $25,000 monthly total it must constrain to, leaving $2,998, which it must set 2017_wk32 to to balance the equation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">in cases where a change the user makes would force the system to drive unlocked values negative to resolve equations, and error message will be raised, notifying the user which fields will be driven negative, and the change will be reverted</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
