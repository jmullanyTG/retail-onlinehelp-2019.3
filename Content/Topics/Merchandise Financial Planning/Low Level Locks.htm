        <h1>Cell Lock Example</h1>
        <p>The simplest locking scenario is when we lock a single period of sales to keep its sales values intact when changes are made at aggregate levels above it</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In the above example, Sales has been locked for 2017_wk32, also locking Sales Units and AUR in the view</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Sales is changed to $25,000 at the month level, the system subtracts the locked quantity of $5,044 from $25,000, and distributes the remaining $19,956 across the 3 unlocked periods by taking their percent contribution to the old Sales total, rebalancing them to equal 100%, then multiplying by $19,956</p>
