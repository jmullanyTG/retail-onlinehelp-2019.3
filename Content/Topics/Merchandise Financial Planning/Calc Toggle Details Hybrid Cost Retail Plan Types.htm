                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the default Sales calc toggle, this is employed when the user wishes to change sales revenue and units while maintaining the planned average selling price (AUR) per unit</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Sales has been changed to $1,000 for 2017_wk27</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that Sales Units has increased to 369 while AUR has remained at $2.71 to balance the change in Sales</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HOLD: Sales Units, ACT, AUT | CALC: AUR, Markdowns, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the alternate calc toggle for Sales allows for a slightly different approach in which the user wishes to maintain Sales Units while adjusting the average selling price (AUR) per unit</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Sales has again been changed to $1,000 for 2017_wk27</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>But now Sales Units holds at 290 while AUR increases to $3.45 to balance the change in Sales</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales Units</li>
            <li>HOLD: AUR, AUC, AUT | CALC: Sales, COGS, Markdowns, IMU %, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">very similar to the default toggle for Sales, the default calc toggle for Sales Units is employed when the user wishes to maintain the average selling price (AUR) per unit while allowing sales revenue to change</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Sales Units have been changed to 350 for 2017_wk27</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Sales changes to $1,207 while AUR holds at $3.45 to balance the change in Sales Units</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HOLD: Sales, AUC, AUT | CALC: AUR, COGS, Markdowns, IMU %, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the alternate toggle for Sales Units allows for a different approach, flexing AUR while maintaining sales revenue</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Sales Units have again been changed to 350 for 2017_wk27</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>But now, Sales holds at $1,000 while AUR decreases to $2.86 to balance the change in Sales Units</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AUR</li>
            <li>HOLD: Sales Units, AUC, AUT | CALC: Sales, Markdowns, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the default calc toggle for AUR is employed when the user desires to change the average selling price per unit but keep the number of units being sold intact as sales revenue flexes</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_7.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, AUR has been decreased to $3.00 for 2017_wk27, creating a $1 difference between AUT (average ticket price per unit) and AUR</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_8.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that, while Sales Units has held at 350, Sales has decreased to $1,050, also creating $350 in markdowns (the difference between AUT &amp; AUR * Sales Units), thus, changing AUR is also a useful means of adjusting profitability and managing markdowns in a given period</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HOLD: Sales, AUC, AUT | CALC: Sales Units, COGS, Markdowns, IMU %, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the alternate calc toggle for AUR performs a very similar function but holds sales revenue, allowing the user to change the average selling price while adjusting sales units to balance the change</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_7.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, AUR has again been decreased to $3.00 for 2017_wk27, creating a $1 difference between AUT (average ticket price per unit) and AUR</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_9.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In this example, though, Sales has now held at $1,400, while Sales Units has recalculated to 467, also creating $467 in Markdowns ( ($4.00 - $3.00) * 467)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IMU %</li>
            <li>HOLD: Sales, Sales Units, AUC | CALC: AUT, Markdowns, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the default calc toggle for IMU % is employed primarily when the user wants to change IMU % while keeping average cost per unit (AUC) intact. The two primary components of IMU % are AUC and AUT (average ticket price per unit), so since this toggle holds AUC, it recalculates AUT to balance the change</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, IMU % has been increased to 80% for 2017_wk28, indicating a desire for a higher average ticket price per unit</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_11.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice the increase in AUT to balance the increase in IMU% while AUC remains unchanged. Markdowns have also increased, as the gap between AUT and AUR has increased. MMU% does not recalc in this Cost based plan because COGS, a component of MMU (product), does not subtract markdowns in Cost method</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HOLD: Sales, Sales Units, AUT | CALC: AUC, COGS, MMU % (not available in Retail method)</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the alternate calc toggle for IMU % is employed primarily when the user wants to change IMU % while keeping average ticket price per unit (AUC) intact. The two primary components of IMU % are AUC and AUT (average ticket price per unit), so since this toggle holds AUT, it recalculates AUC to balance the change</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, IMU % has been increased to 80% for 2017_wk28, indicating a desire for a lower average cost per unit</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_12.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice the decrease in AUC to balance the increase in IMU% while AUT remains unchanged. Markdowns remain unchanged because the relationship between AUT and AUR doesn’t change. MMU %, however, increases, because AUC (and as a result, COGS, decreases, increasing the profit margin between the cost of goods and sales</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Markdowns</li>
            <li>HOLD: AUT, Sales, AUC | CALC: Sales Units, AUR, COGS, IMU %, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the default calc toggle for Markdowns is employed when a user desires to create markdowns by decreasing the average selling price per unit (AUR) while holding Sales intact</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_13.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Markdowns have been increased to $2,122 for 2017_wk28, necessitating a $1 difference between AUT and AUR, since Markdowns, in Retail method plans, are equal to (AUT – AUR) * BOP Units ($2,122 = ($4.00 – X) * 2,122)</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_14.png" />
        </p>
        <p>AUR must become $3.00 to equate the entered Markdowns value and BOP Units, but because this calc toggle also holds Sales intact, Sales Units must also recalculate to 247 to balance the change ($740 / $3.00 = 247). Lastly, MMU % recalculates as a result of the entered Markdowns value</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HOLD: AUT, Sales Units, AUC | CALC: Sales, AUR, MMU %</li>
            <li>
                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the alternate calc toggle for Markdowns is employed when a user desires to create markdowns by decreasing the average selling price per unit (AUR) while holding Sales Units intact</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_15.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Markdowns have been increased to $1,028 for 2017_wk28, necessitating a $1 difference between AUT and AUR, since Markdowns, in Cost method plans, are equal to (AUT – AUR) * Sales Units ($1,028 = ($4.00 – X) * 1,028)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_16.png" />
        </p>
        <p>AUR must become $3.00 to equate the entered Markdowns value and Sales Units, but because this calc toggle also holds Sales Units intact, Sales must also recalculate to $3,085 to balance the change (1,028 * $3.00 = $3,085). Lastly, MMU % recalculates as a result of the change in Sales</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Target Receipt Retail</li>
            <li>HOLD: Target Receipt AUC, Target Receipt AUT | CALC: Target Receipt Units, Target Receipt Cost</li>

                <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE: &lt;/b&gt;">the default calc toggle for Target Receipt Retail is employed when the user wishes to change the retail value of planned receipts while keeping the average cost and average ticket price per receipt unit (Target Receipt AUC and AUT) intact</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In the example above, Target Receipt Retail has been increased to $15,000 for 2017_wk28, indicating a desire to also increase the receipt units for the period</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Calc Toggle Details Hybrid Cost Retail Plan Types_18.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Target Receipt Units must recalculate to 750 to balance this change (Target Receipt Retail / Target Receipt AUT: $15,000 / $20.00 = 750). Consequently, the change in units also causes Target Receipt Cost to increase to $3,750, as Target Receipt Cost = Target Receipt AUC * Target Receipt Units</li>

Consequently, the change in units also causes Target Receipt IMU % increase to 76.67% because of the increased profit potential created by the increase in Target Receipt AUT over Target Receipt AUC</li>
