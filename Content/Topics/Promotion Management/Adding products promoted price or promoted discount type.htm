        <h1>Adding products: promoted price or promoted discount type Promotion Strategies</h1>
        <p>For Promoted Price and Promoted Discount type Promotion Strategies there are three ways to add products. They are not mutually exclusive and all three methods can be used within a Promotion.</p>
        <p>Once all the products have been added to the Promotion, they will be displayed in a group called Item Group below the Promotion Group.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> Enter default pricing information for all Products and all Site Clusters in the fields for Promoted Price and Promoted discount type strategies in the left pane. The information to be entered will differ based on the Promotion Strategy selected and can be modified further at the Site Cluster level after the new Promotion is saved.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If the group you wish to add is not available, first ensure the filter selected in the pop up is for “All Variants/Item Masters”. If still unavailable, navigate to Content Manager to create the group you require for the Promotion.</li>
            <li>These groups are dynamic, meaning the system will update the associated products included in the group dependent on the filter criteria used to create the group. This update will only occur as long as the Promotion is in an unlocked state.</li>
            <li>When adding a group to a Promotion, the system creates a copy of the original group, including the filter criteria used to define the Group, so that changes can be made at the Promotion level without affecting the originating product group.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>For information on creating, editing, and deleting filters, refer to the Filters section in the online help.</p>
