        <h1>Price Detail – display positions (slots)</h1>
        <p>The second tab of the Price Detail screen allows you to assign the Promotion directly into an open Slot in an Event Slot Set. Ensure the <b>Parameters</b> button is enabled. To load all available Slots, select ‘All’ from the Available Events View Option and click <b>Execute</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The grid will then display a row for every Slot contained in an Event that has overlapping Sale Dates and some Sites in common with the current Promotion.</p>

        <p>A checkmark in the ‘Assigned’ column signifies that the current Promotion has already been placed in that Slot. Event Slots do not appear in the grid, signify that either a different Promotion has been placed the Slot or you do not have access to the Space that the Slot is in. A Slot may be displayed across more than one row if the Promotion in the Slot is not associated with all Geographies in the Event.</p>
        <p>The ‘Available Events View Option’ drop down list determines which accessible Slots from overlapping Events are displayed in the grid. Select one of the options below and click <b>Execute</b> to alter the Slots displayed in the grid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>All</b> – Show Slots that are available or assigned to the current Promotion.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Available</b> – Show Slots that do not have Promotions assigned to all Event Geographies.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Assigned</b> – Show Slots that the current Promotion has been assigned to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To assign the Promotion to an available Event Slot, place a checkmark in the ‘Assigned’ column of the applicable row in the grid, click <b>Save</b> and click <b>Ok</b> in the window. </p>
        <p>Once a Promotion has been assigned to a Slot, the pane on the right will load to display all of the Products and Product Groups associated with the Promotion.  </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Selecting the ‘Featured’ check box beside one Product (Item or Group) in this pane will apply the selected Product’s Master Content and the Pricing to the Event’s Slot. </p>
        <p>Click <b>Save</b>, above the right pane, to apply the Content and Pricing selections to the Event Slot. The ability to push a specific Product’s Content and pricing is not available for BOGO AB type Promotions.</p>
