        <h1>Promotion Validations</h1>
        <p>Validations may be configured as a mathematical formula using SQL or as an installed stored procedure for more complex requirements. If new Validations are required, and you are unsure how to best implement,  contact Mi9 Retail Demand Management Support or your Professional Service team. To change the severity level of a Validation, select the Severity column, choose a new level from the drop down list and click Save.</p>
