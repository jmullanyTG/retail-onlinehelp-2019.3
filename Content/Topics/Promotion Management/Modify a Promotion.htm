        <h1>Modify a Promotion</h1>
        <p>When a new Promotion is saved or an existing Promotion opened, the system will display a new tab with the Promotion Detail screen.&#160; This tab will allow you, if you have the appropriate rights, to modify all aspects of the Promotion.</p>
        <p>The Promotion screen is divided into two main sections: the upper portion will display the list of Promotion Site Clusters with their assigned Promotion Strategies which allows you to tailor the Promotion for specific sets of Sites as needed. It also includes several buttons to allow you to modify the Sites assigned to the Site Clusters for the Promotion.</p>
        <p>The lower portion will display the selected Site Cluster’s products, pricing details, bids (if configured), companion items (if configured), and analysis. This allows you to modify the promotional products and pricing details to be specific for each Site Cluster. In the left pane on the Site Cluster Items and Price Details tabs, you may view or edit Promotional Pricing for the selected Site Cluster. When applied, those changes will affect the pricing data in the right pane of the Price Details tab.</p>

        <p>Click the Details button on the top right of the upper portion to display the Promotion detail pane. You can use this pane to review and modify a promotion’s details including Workflow and privacy setting. For example, a promotion with a status of Private can be modified to a status of Public so that other users can see it after its information is no longer considered sensitive.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">A user’s ability to modify a promotion’s privacy configuration is based on the user’s ability to edit the promotion (the user's rights for a Promotion's Status and Validation State in conjunction with Blacklisting).</p>
