        <h1>Rounding Rules</h1>
        <p>Rounding Rules allow you to create grouped Rounding Criteria, to be applied to a Promotion Calculation to conform to corporate price rounding standards. The solution can be configured with both ‘standard’ rounding as well as rounding with ‘price endings’.</p>
        <p>‘Price Ending’ rounding refers to selection a numeric position and rounding it up/down/closest to the configured price ending value based on the preceding numeric position value.</p>
        <p>A set of criteria, knows as Rounding Criteria, should be defined for each Rounding Rule to determine which prices the rule should be acted upon and what should be done to the price.</p>
