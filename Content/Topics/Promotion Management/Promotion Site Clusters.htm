        <h1>Promotion Site Clusters</h1>
        <p>The Site Clusters area displays the Promotion Site Clusters, each with their associated Promotion Strategy and Sites. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>If a Site Cluster that contains Sites with more than one currency is used in a Promotion, the Site Cluster will be split to display an instance of the Site Cluster for each currency. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Site Cluster ‘A’ consists of Site Alpha (USD), Site Beta (USD), Site Gamma (CAD), and Site Delta (USD).</li>
            <li>Site Cluster ‘A’ is added to a Site Cluster Set which is used in a Promotion.</li>
            <li>The top area of the Promotion will display the following rows for Site Cluster A in the list of Promotion Site Clusters: ‘A (USD)’ and ‘A (CAD)’, each with their respective Sites that match the currency appended to the Site Cluster name.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Site Clusters area allows you to modify the Promotion Strategy at the Site Cluster level. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the Site Cluster that will be promoted differently.</li>
            <li>Modify the Promotion Strategy as needed.</li>
            <li>The Promotion will be saved automatically.</li>
        </ul>
