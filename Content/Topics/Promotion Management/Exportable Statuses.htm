        <h1>Exportable Statuses</h1>
        <p>The Exportable Statuses grid provides the ability to determine when an export will occur. Only those Promotions and Events with a Status that is considered exportable will be trigger an export. All Statuses are dynamically displayed based on the Statuses defined in the Workflow solution.</p>

        <p>To identify a Status as exportable, place a checkmark in the Exportable column of the Status and click on Save.</p>
