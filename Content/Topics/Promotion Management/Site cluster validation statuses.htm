        <h1>Site cluster validation statuses</h1>
        <p>The first column allows you to see at a glance the Validation Status of the Promotion for each Site Cluster. The possible Statuses are (most severe to least):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red no entry <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Promotion Validation Statuses.png" /> – An error was found so you must review the Promotion to resolve the problem.</li>
            <li>Orange exclamation <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Promotion Validation Statuses_1.png" /> – A Validation warning was encountered.</li>
            <li>Green ‘i’ <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Promotion Validation Statuses_2.png" /> – Validation ran successfully but additional information is available to review.</li>
            <li>Red exclamation <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Promotion Validation Statuses_3.png" /> – A Calculation is required before a Validation Status can be assigned, so you must either manually open the Promotion and recalculate, or it can be recalculated by an overnight process.</li>
            <li>Green checkmark <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Promotion Validation Statuses_4.png" /> – The Promotion is successfully validated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most severe Validation Status at the Site Cluster level will roll up to display the Validation Status at the Promotion level.</p>
