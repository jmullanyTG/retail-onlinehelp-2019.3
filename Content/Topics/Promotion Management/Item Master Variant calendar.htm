        <h1>Item Master/Variant calendar</h1>
        <p>The Item Master/Variant (i.e. depending on the environment configuration) Calendar displays a Gantt chart view of the Promotions loaded against products over time. Double clicking a Promotion, within the calendar, will open up the Promotion Detail of screen for review.</p>
        <p>The Time Scale ‘+’ and ‘–‘ buttons can be used to view Promotions displayed by time of day, day, week, month, quarter or year. <b>Filter</b> can be used to filter the list of Promotions as in the List tab.</p>
