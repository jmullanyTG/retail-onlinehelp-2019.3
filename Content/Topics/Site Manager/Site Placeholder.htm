        <h1>Site Placeholder </h1>
        <p>You can create placeholder sites for use with Assortment Planning, Merchandise Financial Planning, Allocations, and Adaptive Allocations. These virtual sites can facilitate planning for stores that do not yet have mater data in your ERP system. </p>
        <p>For example, in Allocations, you can use placeholder stores to create initial orders for a soon-to-open store and then  reserve stock for the new store at the Distribution Center (DC). In Assortment Planning and Merchandise Financial Planning, placeholder stores can be used to represent stores that will open soon.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;"> When master data for a store is imported, the placeholder store maps itself to the real store’s site code and all data related to the placeholder site references the new, permanent site.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>The following <a href="../Users/Site Manager.htm">user rights</a> are required to add, modify, and delete placeholder sites.</p>
        <p>Right Group: Site Manager</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow Deletion of Placeholder Sites</li>
            <li>Allow Updating of Placeholder Sites</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Site Placeholder Tab</h2>
        <p>Placeholder sites are created and managed from the Site Placeholder tab in the Site Manager’s Details pane. When created there, they are accessible through site filters in supported solutions. Placeholder sites can only be created for stores, not DCs or DC/Stores.</p>
        <h3>To Create a Placeholder Site</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Site Placeholder tab in Order Manager, click <b>New</b> to add a new row to the Site Placeholder grid.</li>
            <li>In the new row, enter details for the placeholder site.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Execute</b> . The new placeholder site is saved.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Placeholders and Order Management</h2>
        <p>Demand Management does not distinguish between orders for real and placeholder sites. The workflow for these are the same. Authorized orders to placeholder sites are sent to your ERP system. If you do not want orders to placheolder sites to be sent to your ERP, set up a validation in your export process to block such orders.</p>
        <h2>Filtering Placeholder Sites</h2>
        <p>The <b>Is Placeholder Site?</b> field is used in site filters to identify placeholder sites.</p>
