        <h1>Site Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>From Site Manager, you can view and modify information about your sites.</p>
        <h2>Site Manager Documents</h2>
        <p>Site data is managed on tabs called Site Manager Documents. The collection of sites displayed in a Site Manager Document is controlled by a filter, which allows you to quickly limit the sites you are working on to only those that need your attention. You can have multiple documents open at a time, and each document can list a separate set of sites. </p>
        <h2>Site Modeling</h2>
        <p>When opening a new store or Distribution Center (DC), you can choose an existing store or DC to model forecasts after. This creates a store supersession, which tells Demand Management to use the product-level sales history from the model site to forecast demand for the new site. Orders for the new site can then be generated based on the modeled forecasts. </p>

        <h2>Global Priority</h2>
        <p>Global priority sets the default order in which sites should be sourced when any site experiences a shortfall in stock. For more information about source prioritization, see <a href="../Supply Chain/Supply Chain Overview.htm">Customizable source priority</a>.</p>
