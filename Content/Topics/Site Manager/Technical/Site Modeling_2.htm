        <h1>Site Modeling</h1>
        <p>The hierarchy used to populate the product dimension within this widget is determined by the following system policy: <b>Site Modeling: Product Hierarchy</b></p>
        <h2>Sales History</h2>
        <p>Site modeling will create entries in <span class="code_sample">tbl_SalesHistoryByType</span> as supersession sales history. In order to process the site modeling data, <span class="code_sample">usp_Site_Model_ProcessModelData</span> must be run. It is recommended to add this procedure as a task within the daily job, or as frequently as sales history is updated within Demand Management. </p>
        <h2>Site Opening Date</h2>
        <p>The site opening date is read from <span class="code_sample">tbl_Site_Status_Temporal</span>. It is the minimum of start dates where site status is 1 (open).</p>
