        <h1>Workload Queue Priorities</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Synchronous</b> - Bypasses the Workload Queue and runs in parallel with any queued Batches.</li>
            <li>Immediate - The Batch estimated workload was calculated to run first during the daily time frame, in parallel with Synchronous Batches.</li>
            <li>
                <b>ASAP</b> - The Batch estimated workload was calculated to run during the daily time frame, after Immediate Batches, taking into account escalation based upon the Batch’s S-Curve time factor.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Low Priority</b> - The Batch estimated workload was calculated to run during the daily time frame, after ASAP and Immediate Batches, taking into account escalation based upon the Batch’s S-Curve time factor.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Nightly</b> - The Batch estimated workload was calculated to run during the nightly time frame, after Low Priority, ASAP and Immediate Batches, taking into account escalation based upon the Batch’s S-Curve time factor.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Weekend</b> - The Batch estimated workload was calculated to run during the weekend time frame, after Nightly, Low Priority, ASAP and Immediate Batches, taking into account escalation based upon the Batch’s S-Curve time factor.</li>
