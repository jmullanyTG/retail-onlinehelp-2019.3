        <h1>Modify a Batch priority</h1>
        <p>There may be a need to escalate or de-escalate a Batch’s priority. A Super User with access to the Workload Queue screen, with permissions to reprioritize, may modify a Batch that has not started its execution.</p>
        <p>To modify a Batch’s priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the priority drop down.</li>
            <li>Select the new appropriate Priority Type.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b> to commit the modification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Multiple Batches’ priority may be modified before clicking <b>Save</b> to commit the modification(s) which will cause the system to refresh the list with the updated priorities.</p>
        <p>Escalation of a Batch’s priority will not cause a change to its Expiration Date, where as a de-escalation will.&#160; </p>
